<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The reflecting portion of mankind has ever felt
desirous of becoming acquainted with the origin,
progress, habits, and peculiarities of those whom the
powers of genius may have raised above the plane
of intellectual equality; but neither the nature of
the information, nor the extent of the detail that
may be necessary to satisfy so laudable a curiosity,
can ever be estimated by any common standard,
since it is not in our nature to contemplate an object
of admiration, but with reference to our own
predilections and sympathies; and hence every
reader will form a scale for himself, according to
the degree of interest he may feel for the particular
character under review. The Poetical enthusiast,
who could not sufficiently express his gratitude on
being told that Milton wore shoe-buckles, would
very probably not have given 'four farthings,' as
Gray says, to know that the shoes of Davy were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
tanned by catechu; and yet if the relative value of
this information were fairly estimated, it must be admitted
that the former is a matter of barren curiosity,
the latter, a fact of some practical utility. In a
word, we very naturally connect the man with his
works, and we care not to extend our acquaintance
with the one, but in proportion as we have derived
pleasure from the other.</p>

<p>In like manner, very different estimates will be
formed of the degree of praise due to a distinguished
philosopher, because the few who are deeply imbued
with a knowledge of the science he may have
adorned and enlightened must not only appreciate
the value of his labours, but understand the difficulties
which opposed the accomplishment of them, before
they can arrive at a sound decision upon the
question: and here again the judgment of the most
scientific may be unfortunately warped; it may be
corrupted by secret passions or sinister influences;
be distorted by the prejudices of education and habit,
or unduly biassed by invincible prepossessions.</p>

<p>No man ever soared, like an eagle, to the pinnacle
of fame, without exciting the envy and perhaps the
hatred of those who could only crawl up half-way;
while, on the other hand, where no rivalry can
exist, the splendour of such an ascent will captivate
the bystander, and by exciting intemperate triumph
and unqualified admiration, change without diminishing
the sources of erroneous judgment, and substitute
adulation for calumny. Under such circumstances,
an allusion even to the common frailties of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
genius becomes offensive; the biographer is called
upon for the delineation of a perfect man; but the
world is satisfied with nothing short of 'a faultless
monster;' and yet, while they would impose upon
him the same restraint as Queen Elizabeth laid
upon her artist&mdash;to execute a portrait without a
single shadow, they little imagine how completely
they obscure the features of their idol, by the haze
of incense in which they continually envelope it.
These are evils against which a future historian will
not have to contend; for time tries the characters
of men, as the furnace assays the quality of metals,
by disengaging the impurities, dissipating the superficial
irridescence, and leaving the sterling gold
bright and pure.</p>

<p>Nor can the extent of our obligations to a philosopher
be appreciated until time shall have shown
the various important purposes to which his discoveries
may administer. The names of Mayow and
Hales might have been lost in the stream of discovery,
had not the results of Priestley and Lavoisier
shown the value and importance of their statical
experiments on the chemical relations of air to other
substances. The discoveries of Dr. Black on the
subject of <em>latent</em> heat could never have obtained
that celebrity they now enjoy, had not Mr. Watt
availed himself of their application for the improvement
of the steam-engine; and the views of Sir H.
Davy respecting the true nature of chlorine become
daily more important from the discovery of new
elements of an analogous nature. In future ages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
the metals of the alkalies and earths may admit of
applications, and open new avenues of knowledge,
of which at present we can form no idea; but it is
obvious that, in the page of history, his name will
gather fame in proportion as such discoveries unfold
themselves.</p>

<p>It must be admitted, that such considerations
may furnish an argument against the propriety of
writing the life of a contemporaneous philosopher;
and yet I will never admit, with Mr. Babbage, that
"the volume of his biography should be sealed,
until the warm feelings of surviving kindred and
admiring friends shall be cold as the grave, from
which remembrance vainly recalls his cherished form,
invested with all the life and energy of recent
existence."</p>

<p>Is it not possible that the errors of partiality,
which have so frequently been charged upon the
writer on these occasions, may often be ascribed,
with greater truth and justice, to the prejudices of
the reader&mdash;that, after all, the distortion might not
have existed in the portrait itself, but in the optics
of the observer? Such an opinion, however, even
were it true, carries along with it no consolation to
the biographer; for I know of no method by which
the picture can be adapted to the focus of every eye.</p>

<p>If, however, contemporaneous biography has its
difficulties and impediments, so has it also its advantages.
Dr. Johnson has remarked, in his Life
of Addison, that "History may be formed from
permanent monuments and records; but Lives can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
only be written from personal knowledge, which is
growing every day less, and in a short time is lost
for ever. The delicate features of the mind, the
nice discriminations of character, and the minute
peculiarities of conduct, are soon obliterated."</p>

<p>I did not enter upon this arduous and delicate
task, without a distinct conception of the various
difficulties which would necessarily oppose its accomplishment.
I well knew that the biographer of
Davy must hold himself prepared for the dissatisfaction
of one party at the commendations he might
bestow, and for the displeasure of the other at the
penury of his praise, or the asperity of his criticism.</p>

<p>After great labour and much anxiety, I have at
length completed the work; and in giving it to the
world, I shall apply to myself the words of Swift&mdash;"I
have the ambition to wish, at least, that both
parties may think me in the right; but if that is
not to be hoped for, my next wish should be, that
both might think me in the wrong, which I would
understand as an ample justification of myself, and a
sure ground to believe that I have proceeded, at least,
with impartiality, and perhaps even with truth."</p>

<p>It is certainly due to myself, and perhaps to the
world, to state the circumstances by which I was
induced to undertake a work requiring for its completion
a freedom from anxiety, and an extent of
research, scarcely compatible with the occupations
of a laborious profession; and which, I may add,
has been wholly composed during night, in hours
stolen from sleep. Very shortly after the death of Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
Humphry Davy, an account of his life, written by
no friendly hand, nor 'honest chronicler,' was submitted
for my judgment by a Journalist who had
intended to insert it in his paper. At my request,
it was committed to the flames; but not until I had
promised to supply the loss by another memoir.
The sketches by which I redeemed this pledge were
published in a weekly journal&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Spectator</span>;
and they have since been copied into various other
works, sometimes with, but frequently without any
acknowledgment. They constitute the greater part
of the Life which was printed in the Annual Obituary
for 1829; and they form the introduction to
an edition of his "Last Days," lately published in
America.</p>

<p>I was soon recognised as the writer of these
Sketches; and the leading publishers of the day
urged me to undertake a more extended work. To
these solicitations I returned a direct refusal: I even
declined entering upon any conversation on the occasion;
feeling that the wishes of Lady Davy, at
that time on the Continent, ought in the very first
instance to be consulted on the subject. Had not
the common courtesy of society required such a mark
of attention, the wish expressed by Sir Humphry in
his Will would have rendered it an imperative duty.
On her arrival in London, in consequence of a letter
she had addressed to Mr. Murray, I requested an
interview with her Ladyship, from whom I received
not only an unqualified permission to become the
biographer of her illustrious husband, but also the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
several documents which are published with acknowledgement
in these memoirs. I still felt that
Dr. Davy might desire to accomplish the task of
recording the scientific services of his distinguished
brother; and, had that been the case, I should most
undoubtedly have retired without the least hesitation
or reluctance; but I was assured by those who
were best calculated to form an opinion upon this
point,&mdash;for he was himself absent from England,&mdash;that
motives of delicacy which it was easy to appreciate,
would at once lead him to decline an undertaking
embarrassed with so many personal considerations.
The task, however, of collating the various
works of Sir H. Davy, and of enriching them by
notes derived from his own knowledge of the circumstances
under which they were written, I do
hope will be accomplished by one who is so well
calculated to heighten the interest, and to increase
the value of labours of such infinite importance to
science, and to the best interests of mankind.</p>

<p>The engraving which adorns the volume is from
a painting by Sir Thomas Lawrence, presented to
the Royal Society by Lady Davy; and I beg the
Council of that learned body to accept my thanks for
the permission they so readily granted for its being
engraved. It is one of the happiest efforts of the
distinguished Artist, and is the only portrait I have
seen in which his features are happily animated with
the expression of the poet, and whose eye is bent
to pursue the flights of his imagination through
unexplored regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
I must also embrace this opportunity of publicly
expressing my thanks to the Managers of the Royal
Institution, who, in the most handsome manner,
immediately complied with my request to inspect
their Journals, and to make such extracts from them,
as I might consider necessary for the completion of
my memoirs.</p>

<p>To Mr. Davies Gilbert, I am under obligations
which it is difficult for me to acknowledge in adequate
terms, not only for the value of the materials
with which he has furnished me, but for the kindness
and urbanity with which they were communicated,
and for the ready and powerful assistance
which I have so constantly received from him
during the progress of the work.</p>

<p>To the other enlightened individuals from whom
I have received support, I have acknowledged my
obligations in the body of the work; and should I
have inadvertently passed over any service without
a becoming notice, I trust the extent of the labour
and the circumstances under which it has been performed,
will plead my apology.</p>

<p>Humphry Davy was born at Penzance, in Cornwall,
on the 17th of December 1778.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His ancestors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
had long possessed a small estate at Varfell,
in the parish of Ludgvan, in the Mount's Bay, on
which they resided: this appears from tablets in
the church, one of which bears a date as far back as
1635. We are, however, unable to ascend higher
in the pedigree than to his paternal grandfather,
who seems to have been a builder of considerable
repute in the west of Cornwall, and is said to have
planned and erected the mansion of <em>Trelissick</em>, near
Truro, at present the property and residence of
Thomas Daniel, Esq.</p>

<p>His son, the parent of the illustrious subject of
our history, was sent to London, and apprenticed to
a carver in wood, but, on the death of his father,
who, although originally a younger son, had latterly
become the representative of the family, he found
himself in the possession of a patrimony amply competent
for the supply of his limited desires, and
therefore pursued his art rather as an object of
amusement than one of necessity: in the town and
neighbourhood of Penzance, however, there remain
many specimens of his skill; and I have myself
seen several chimney-pieces curiously embellished
by his chisel.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
I am not able to discover that he was remarkable
for any peculiarity of intellect; he passed through
life without bustle, and quitted it with the usual
regrets of friends and relatives. The habits, however,
generally imputed to him were certainly not
such as would have induced us to anticipate a high
degree of steadiness in the son.</p>

<p>His wife, whose maiden name was Grace Millett,
was remarkable for the placidity of her temper, and
for the amiable and benevolent tendency of her disposition:
she had been adopted and brought up,
together with her two sisters, under circumstances
of affecting interest, by Mr. John Tonkin, an eminent
surgeon and apothecary in Penzance; a person
of very considerable natural endowments, and whose
Socratic sayings are, to this day, proverbial with
many of the older inhabitants.</p>

<p>To withhold a narrative of the circumstances
that led Mr. Tonkin to the adoption of these orphan
children, would be a species of historical fraud and
literary injustice, by which the world would not
only lose one of those bright examples of pure and
disinterested benevolence, which cheer the heart and
ornament our nature, but the medical profession
would be deprived of an additional claim to that
public veneration and regard, to which the kind
sympathy of its professors has so universally entitled
it.</p>

<p>The parents of these children, having been attacked
by a fatal fever, expired within a few hours</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
of each other: the dying agonies of the surviving
mother were sharpened by her reflecting on the forlorn
condition in which her children would be left;
for, although the Milletts were originally aristocratic
and wealthy, the property had undergone so many
subdivisions, as to have left but a very slender provision
for the member of the family to whom she
had united herself.</p>

<p>The affecting appeal which Mrs. Millett is said to
have addressed to her sympathising friend, and medical
attendant, was not made in vain: on her
decease, Mr. Tonkin immediately removed the three
children to his own house, and they continued under
the guardianship of their kind benefactor, until each,
in succession, found a home by marriage.</p>

<p>The eldest sister, Jane, was married to Henry
Sampson, a respectable watchmaker at Penzance;
the youngest, Elizabeth, to her cousin, Leonard
Millett of Marazion; neither of whom had any
family. The second sister, Grace, was married to
Robert Davy, from which union sprang five children,
two boys and three girls, the eldest being
Humphry, the subject of our memoir, and the
second son, John, now Dr. Davy, a Surgeon to
the Forces, and a gentleman distinguished by several
papers in the Philosophical Transactions.</p>

<p>Humphry Davy was nursed by his mother, and
passed his infancy with his parents;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but his childhood,
after they had removed from Penzance to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
reside on their estate at Varfell, was spent partly
with them and partly with Mr. John Tonkin, who
extended his disinterested kindness from the mother
to all her children, but more especially to Humphry,
who is said, when a child, to have exhibited
powers of mind superior to his years. I have spared
no pains in collecting materials for the illustration
of the earlier periods of his history; as, to estimate
the magnitude of an object, we must measure the
base with accuracy, in order to comprehend the elevation
of its summit.</p>

<p>He was first placed at a preparatory seminary
kept by a Mr. Bushell, who was so struck with the
progress he made, that he urged his father to
remove him to a superior school.</p>

<p>It is a fact worthy, perhaps, of being recorded,
that he would at the age of about five years turn
over the pages of a book as rapidly as if he were
merely engaged in counting the number of leaves,
or in hunting after pictures; and yet, on being
questioned, he could generally give a very satisfactory
account of the contents. I have been informed
by Lady Davy that the same faculty was retained
by him through life, and that she has often been
astonished, beyond the power of expression, at the
rapidity with which he read a work, and the accuracy
with which he remembered it. Mr. Children
has also communicated to me an anecdote, which
may be related in illustration of the same quality.
Shortly after Dr. Murray had published his system
of chemistry, Davy accompanied Mr. Children in
an excursion to Tonbridge, and the new work was
placed in the carriage. During the occasional intervals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
in which their conversation was suspended,
Davy was seen turning over the leaves of the book,
but his companion did not believe it possible that
he could have made himself acquainted with any
part of its contents, until at the close of the journey
he surprised him with a critical opinion of its
merits.</p>

<p>The book that engaged his earliest attention was
"The Pilgrim's Progress," a production well calculated,
from the exuberance of its invention, and the
rich colouring of its fancy, for seizing upon the
ardent imagination of youth. This pleasing work,
it will be remembered, was the early and especial
favourite of Dr. Franklin, who never alluded to it
but with feelings of the most lively delight.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, he commenced reading history,
particularly that of England; and at the age
of eight years he would, as if impressed with the
powers of oratory, collect together a number of
boys in a circle, and mounting a cart or carriage
that might be standing before the inn near Mr.
Tonkin's house, harangue them on different subjects,
and offer such comments as his own ideas
might suggest.</p>

<p>He was, moreover, at this age, a great lover of
the marvellous, and amused himself and his schoolfellows
by composing stories of romance and tales
of chivalry, with all the fluency of an Italian improvisatore;
and joyfully would he have issued
forth, armed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-à-pié</i>, in search of adventures, and
to free the world of dragons and giants.</p>

<p>In this early fondness for fiction, and in the
habit of exercising his ingenuity in creating imagery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
for the gratification of his fancy, Davy and Sir
Walter Scott greatly resembled each other. The
Author of Waverley, in his general preface to the
late edition of his novels, has given us the following
account of this talent. "I must refer to a very
early period of my life, were I to point out my first
achievement as a tale-teller; but I believe most of
my old schoolfellows can still bear witness that I
had a distinguished character for that talent, at a
time when the applause of my companions was
my recompense for the disgraces and punishments
which the future romance-writer incurred for being
idle himself, and keeping others idle, during hours
that should have been employed on our tasks."
Had not Davy's talents been diverted into other
channels, who can say that we might not have received
from his inventive pen a series of romantic
tales, as beautifully illustrative of the early history
of his native country as are the Waverley Novels of
that of Scotland? for Cornwall is by no means deficient
in elfin sprites and busy "<i>piskeys</i>;" the invocation
is alone required to summon them from their
dark recesses and mystic abodes.</p>

<p>Davy was also in the frequent habit of writing
verses and ballads; of making fireworks, and of preparing
a particular detonating composition, to which
he gave the name of "Thunder-powder," and which
he would explode on a stone to the great wonder
and delight of his young playfellows.</p>

<p>Another of his favourite amusements may also be
recorded in this place; for, however trifling in itself
the incident may appear, to the biographer it is full
of interest, as tending to show the early existence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
of that passion for experiment, which afterwards
rose so nobly in its aims and objects, as the mind expanded
with the advancement of his years. It consisted
in scooping out the inside of a turnip, placing
a lighted candle in the cavity, and then exhibiting
it as a lamp; by the aid of which he would melt
fragments of tin, obtained from the metallic blocks
which commonly lie about the streets of a coinage
town, and demand from his companions a certain
number of pins for the privilege of witnessing the
operation.</p>

<p>At an early age, but I am unable to ascertain the
exact period, he was placed at the Grammar-School
in Penzance, under the Rev. J. C. Coryton; and
whilst his father resided at Varfell, he lived with
Mr. Tonkin, except during the holidays, which he
always spent with his parents.</p>

<p>He was extremely fond of fishing; and I have
been lately informed by one of his earliest companions,
that when very young he greatly excelled in
that art. "I have known him," says my correspondent,
"catch grey-mullet at Penzance Pier, when
none of us could succeed. The mullet is a very difficult
fish to hook, on account of the diminutive size
of its mouth; but Davy adopted a plan of his own
contrivance. Observing that they always swam in
shoals, he attached a succession of pilchards to a
string, reaching from the surface to the bottom of
the sea, and while his prey were swimming around
the bait, he would by a sudden movement of the
string entangle several of them on the hooks, and
thus dexterously capture them."</p>

<p>As soon as he became old enough to carry a gun,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
a portion of his leisure hours was passed in the recreation
of shooting; a pursuit which also enabled
him to form a collection of the rare birds which
occasionally frequented the neighbourhood, and
which he is said to have stuffed with more than
ordinary skill.</p>

<p>When at home, he frequently amused himself with
reading and sketching, and sometimes with caricaturing
any thing which struck his fancy; on some
occasions he would shut himself up in his room,
arrange the chairs, and lecture to them by the hour
together.</p>

<p>I have been informed by one of his schoolfellows,
a gentleman now highly distinguished for his literary
attainments, that, in addition to the amusements
already noticed, he was very fond of playing at
"Tournament," fabricating shields and visors of
pasteboard, and lances of wood, to which he gave
the appearance of steel by means of black-lead. Thus
equipped, the juvenile combatants, like Ascanius
and the Trojan youths of classic recollection, would
tilt at each other, and perform a variety of warlike
evolutions.</p>

<p>By this anecdote we are forcibly reminded of the
early taste of Sir William Jones, who, when a boy
at Harrow School, invented a political play, in which
William Bennet, Bishop of Cloyne, and the celebrated
Dr. Parr, were his principal associates. They
divided the fields in the neighbourhood of Harrow,
according to a map of Greece, into states and kingdoms;
each fixed upon one as his dominion, and
assumed an ancient name. Some of their schoolfellows
consented to be styled Barbarians, who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
to invade their territories and attack their hillocks,
which they denominated fortresses.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>On one occasion, Davy got up a Pantomime; and
I have very unexpectedly obtained a fly-leaf, torn
out of a Schrevelius' Lexicon, on which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dramatis
Personæ</i>, as well as the names of the young
actors, were registered, as originally cast. This document
appears so interesting, that I have thought
it right to place it on record.</p>

<p>The performers, who, I believe, with one exception,
are all living, will perhaps find some amusement
in examining how far their future characters
were shadowed forth on this occasion. At all events,
I feel confident that they will receive no small gratification
at having their recollections thus carried
back to the joyous scenes of boyhood, connected as
they always are, and must ever be, with the most
delightful associations of our lives.</p>

<p>From Penzance school he went to Truro, in the
year 1793, and finished his education under the Rev.
Dr. Cardew, a gentleman who is distinguished by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the number of eminent scholars with which he has
graced his country.</p>

<p>That he was quick and industrious in his school
exercises, may be inferred from an anecdote related
by his sister, that "on being removed to Truro,
Dr. Cardew found him very deficient in the qualifications
for the Class of his age, but on observing
the quickness of his talents, and his aptitude for
learning, he did not place him in a lower form,
telling him that by industry and attention he trusted
he might be entitled to keep the place assigned
to him; which," his sister says, "he did, to the entire
satisfaction of his master."</p>

<p>It is very natural that an anecdote so gratifying to
the family should have been deeply imprinted on
their memory; but we must not be surprised on
finding that it did not make a similar impression
upon Dr. Cardew. From a letter lately addressed
by that gentleman to Mr. Davies Gilbert, the following
is an extract:&mdash;"With respect to our illustrious
countryman, Sir H. Davy, I fear I can claim
but little merit from the share I had in his education.
He was not long with me; and while he
remained I could not discern the faculties by which
he was afterwards so much distinguished; I discovered,
indeed, his taste for poetry, which I did
not omit to encourage." Dr. Cardew adds, "While
engaged in teaching the classics, I was anxious to
discharge faithfully the duties of my profession to
the best of my ability; but I was certainly fortunate
in having so many good materials to work
upon, and thus having only '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fungi vice cotis</i>,'
though '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exsors ipse secandi</i>.'"&mdash;To the truth of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
latter part of the Doctor's quotation, will his scholars
willingly subscribe? It may be fairly doubted how
far Dr. Cardew was able to descend into the shadowy
regions of Maro, without the "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">donum fatalis
virgæ</i>."</p>

<p>Mrs. Millett thinks that the deficiency just alluded
to may be attributed to Mr. Coryton, rather than
to the inattention of her brother; the former having,
from his neglect as a master, given very general
dissatisfaction. From what I can learn, at this
distant period, of the character of Mr. Coryton, it
appears at all events, that the "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exsors ipse secandi</i>"
could not have been justly applied to him; and that,
owing to an unfortunate aptness in the name to a
doggrel verse, poor Davy had frequently to smart
under his tyranny.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line i0h">Good Master Dàvy;"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>when the master, suiting the action to the rhythm,
inflicted upon the hand of the unlucky scholar the
verberations of that type and instrument of pedagoguish
authority&mdash;the flat ruler. Here we have
another example of the seduction of sound, argued
by our great jurist Mr. Bentham,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to have determined
the maxims of that law, which has been
pronounced by its sages the perfection of reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
From a letter, however, written by Davy a few
years afterwards, respecting the education of a
member of his family, he would appear to have entertained
an opinion not very unlike that of John
Locke; for, although he testifies the highest respect
for Dr. Cardew, he seems to consider the comparative
idleness of his earlier school career, by allowing
him to follow the bent of his own mind, to have
favoured the developement of his peculiar genius.
"After all," he says, "the way in which we are
taught Latin and Greek, does not much influence
the important structure of our minds. I consider it
fortunate that I was left much to myself as a child,
and put upon no particular plan of study, and that I
enjoyed much idleness at Mr. Coryton's school. I
perhaps owe to these circumstances the little talents
I have, and their peculiar application:&mdash;what I am
I have made myself&mdash;I say this without vanity, and
in pure simplicity of heart."</p>

<p>His temper during youth is represented as mild
and amiable. He never suppressed his feelings, but
every action was marked by ingenuousness and candour,
qualities which endeared him to his youthful
associates, and gained him the love of all who knew
him. "Nor can I find," says his sister, "beloved as
he must have been by my mother, that she showed
him any particular preference;&mdash;all her children
appeared to be alike her care, and all alike shared
her affection."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
In 1794, Mr. Davy died. We cannot but regret
that he did not live long enough to witness his son's
eminence; for life, as Johnson says, has few better
things to give than a talented son; but from his
widow, who has but lately descended to the tomb,
full of years and respectability, this boon was not
withheld, she witnessed his whole career of usefulness
and honour, and happily closed her eyes before
her maternal fears could have been awakened by
those signs of premature decay, which for some time
had excited in his friends, and in the friends of science,
an alarm which the recent deplorable event has
too fatally justified.</p>

<p>In the year following the decease of her husband,
Mrs. Davy, who had again taken up her residence
in Penzance, apprenticed her son,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> by the advice of
her long-valued friend, Mr. Tonkin, to Mr. John
Bingham Borlase, at that time a surgeon and apothecary,
but who afterwards obtained a diploma, and
became an eminent physician at Penzance. Davy,
however, for the most part, continued to pursue his
own plans of study; for although his friend Mr.
Tonkin, without doubt, intended him for a general
practitioner in his native town, yet he himself always
looked forward to graduation at Edinburgh, as a
preliminary measure to his practising in the higher
walk of his profession.</p>

<p>His mind had, for some time, been engrossed with
philosophical pursuits; but until after he had been
placed with Mr. Borlase, it does not appear that he
indicated any decided turn for chemistry, the study of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
which he then commenced with all the ardour of his
temperament; and his eldest sister, who acted as his
assistant, well remembers the ravages committed on
her dress by corrosive substances.</p>

<p>It has been said that his mind was first directed to
chemistry by a desire to discover various mixtures
as pigments: a suggestion to which, I confess, I am
not disposed to pay much attention; for although
he might have sought by new combinations to impart
a novel and vivid richness of colouring to his
drawings, it was the character of his mind to pursue
with ardour every subject of novelty, and to get at
results by his own native powers, rather than by the
recorded experience of others.</p>

<p>I must here relate an anecdote, in illustration of
this statement, which has been lately communicated
to me by the Reverend Dr. Batten, the principal of
the East India College at Hayleybury. This gentleman
was one of the earliest of Davy's schoolfellows,
but as he advanced in age, different views, and
a different plan of education, carried him to a distant
part of the kingdom; the discipline and duties of a
cloistered school necessarily estranged him from his
native town; and it was not until after his admission
at Cambridge, and the arrival of the long vacation,
which afforded a temporary oblivion of academic
cares, that Mr. Batten returned to Cornwall, to revisit
the scenes, and to renew the friendships of his
boyish days. Davy, who was at that period an apprentice
to Mr. Borlase, received him with transport
and affection; but he was no longer the boy that his
friend had left him; he had become more serious
and contemplative, fond of solitary rambles, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
averse to enter into society, or to join the festive parties
of the inhabitants. In fact, his mind was now
in the act of being moulded by the spirit of Nature;
and, without the constraint of study, he was insensibly
inhaling knowledge with the wild breezes of his
native hills.</p>

<p>In the course of conversation, Mr. Batten spoke of
his academic studies; and in alluding to the principles
of Mechanics, to which he had lately paid much
attention, he expressed himself more particularly
pleased with that part which treats of "the Collision
of Bodies." What was his surprise, on finding Davy
as well, if not better acquainted with its several propositions!
It was true that he had never systematically
studied the subject&mdash;had never perhaps seen
any standard work upon it, but he had instituted
experiments with elastic and inelastic balls, and had
worked out the results by the unassisted energies of
his own mind. It is clear that, had this branch of
science not existed, Davy would have created it.</p>

<p>During this period of his apprenticeship, he twice
a week attended a French school in Penzance, kept
by a M. Dugast, a priest from La Vendée; and it
was remarked that, although he acquired a knowledge
of the grammatical construction of the language
with greater facility than any of the other
scholars, he could not succeed in obtaining the pronunciation;
and, in fact, notwithstanding his extensive
intercourse with foreigners, and his residence in
France, he never, even in after life, could pronounce
French with correctness or speak it with fluency.</p>

<p>While with Mr. Borlase, it was his constant custom
to walk in the evening to Marazion, to drink
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
tea with an aunt to whom he was greatly attached.
Upon such occasions, his usual companion was a
hammer, with which he procured specimens from
the rocks on the beach. In short, it would appear
that, at this period, he paid much more attention to
Philosophy than to Physic; that he thought more
of the bowels of the earth, than of the stomachs of
his patients; and that, when he should have been
bleeding the sick, he was opening veins in the granite.
Instead of preparing medicines in the surgery, he
was experimenting in Mr. Tonkin's garret, which had
now become the scene of his chemical operations;
and, upon more than one occasion, it is said that he
produced an explosion, which put the Doctor, and all
his glass bottles, in jeopardy. "This boy Humphry
is incorrigible!"&mdash;"Was there ever so idle a dog!"&mdash;"He
will blow us all into the air!" Such were the
constant exclamations of Mr. Tonkin; and then, in
a jocose strain, he would speak of him as the "Philosopher,"
and sometimes call him "Sir Humphry,"
as if prophetic of his future renown.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>His sister has remarked that, as he advanced in life,
he always preferred the society of persons older than
himself; and one of his contemporaries informs me
that he never heard him allude to any subject of
science, although he remembers that while one
of his pockets was filled with fishing-tackle, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
other was as commonly loaded with specimens of
rocks. With those, however, who were superior
to him in years, he delighted to enter into discussion.
At Penzance, there still resides a member of the
Society of Friends, whose ingenuity entitles him to
greater rewards than a provincial town can afford,
with whom Davy, as a boy, was in the constant
habit of discussing questions of practical mechanics.
"I tell thee what, Humphry," exclaimed the Quaker
upon one of these occasions&mdash;"thou art the most
quibbling hand at a dispute I ever met with in my
life."</p>

<p>For the surgical department of the profession, he
always entertained a decided distaste, although the
following extract from a letter of my correspondent
Mr. Le Grice will show that, for once at least, he
had the merit of mending a broken head. "The first
time I ever saw Davy was on the Battery rocks; we
were alone bathing, and he pointed out to me a good
place for diving; at the same time he talked about
the tides, and Sir Isaac Newton, in a manner that
greatly amazed me. I perhaps should not have so
distinctly remembered him, but on the following
day, by not exactly marking the spot he had pointed
out, I was nearly killed by diving on a rock,
and he came as Mr. Borlase's assistant to dress the
wound."</p>

<p>It was his great delight to ramble along the sea-shore,
and often, like the orator of Athens, would
he on such occasions declaim against the howling of
the wind and waves, with a view to overcome a defect
in his voice, which, although only slightly perceptible
in his maturer age, was in the days of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
boyhood exceedingly discordant. I may be allowed
to observe, that the peculiar intonation he employed
in his public addresses, and which rendered him
obnoxious to the charge of affectation, was to be referred
to a laborious effort to conceal this natural
infirmity. It was also clear that he was deficient in
that quality which is commonly called "a good ear,"
and with which the modulation of the voice is generally
acknowledged to have an obvious connexion.
Those who knew him intimately will readily bear
testimony to this fact. Whenever he was deeply
absorbed in a chemical research, it was his habit to
hum some tune, if such it could be called, for it was
impossible for any one to discover the air he intended
to sing: indeed, Davy's music became a subject
of raillery amongst his friends; and Mr. Children
informs me, that, during an excursion, they attempted
to teach him the air of 'God save the King,' but
their efforts were unavailing.</p>

<p>It may be a question how far the following fact,
with which I have just been made acquainted, admits
of explanation upon this principle. On entering
a volunteer infantry corps, commanded by a
Captain Oxnam, Davy could never emerge from the
awkward squad; no pains could make him keep the
step; and those who were so unfortunate as to stand
before him in the ranks, ought to have been heroes
invulnerable in the heel. This incapacity, as may
be readily supposed, occasioned him considerable
annoyance, and he engaged a serjeant to give him
private lessons, but it was all to no purpose. In the
platoon exercise he was not more expert; and he
whose electric battery was destined to triumph over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
the animosity of nations, could never be taught to
shoulder a musket in his native town.</p>

<p>That Davy, in his youth, possessed courage and
decision, may be inferred from the circumstance of
his having, upon receiving a bite from a dog supposed
to be rabid, taken his pocket-knife, and without
the least hesitation cut out the part on the spot,
and then retired into the surgery and cauterized the
wound; an operation which confined him to Mr.
Tonkin's house for three weeks. The gentleman
from whom I received an account of this adventure,
the accuracy of which has been since confirmed by
Davy's sister, also told me, that he had frequently
heard him declare his disbelief in the existence of
pain whenever the energies of the mind were directed
to counteract it; but he added, "I very shortly
afterwards had an opportunity of witnessing a practical
refutation of this doctrine in his own person;
for upon being bitten by a conger eel, my young
friend Humphry roared out most lustily."</p>

<p>The anecdote of Davy's excising the bitten part
with so much promptitude and coolness, derives its
interest from the age and inexperience of the operator.
In the course of his practice, every physician
must have met with similar cases of stern decision;
but I will venture to say that they have never occurred
except in instances of persons of acknowledged
courage. Not many days since, a veteran officer, distinguished
for the intrepidity with which he rescued
the person of George the Third from the fury of a
desperate mob, in St. James's Park, informed me
that he had formerly been bitten at Vienna by a
dog afterwards ascertained to have been rabid; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
immediately entered a blacksmith's shop, and by
threats compelled the person at the forge to heat an
iron red-hot, and burn his leg to the bone. The
blacksmith, after first stipulating that he should
strap his eccentric customer to the anvil, reluctantly
complied; and my friend showed me a scar which
sufficiently testified the complete manner in which
the son of Vulcan had performed his engagement:&mdash;But
to return from this digression.</p>

<p>At this time of day, no one can surely believe
with Pope, that a "Ruling Passion" is an innate
and irresistible affection antecedent to reason and
observation: on the contrary, ample experience has
led us to the conclusion, that</p>

<p class="blockquote2">&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;"men's judgments are<br />
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward<br />
Do draw the inward quality after them."</p>

<p>The prevailing bias of great minds may thus be
often traced to some accidental, and apparently trivial,
impression in early life; and the acute biographer,
in the course of his observations, will continually
discover traits of character that are readily
referable to such a source, even as in the magical
colouring of Rembrandt's works, the practised eye
will recognize the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro-oscuro</i> of his father's mill,
in which the artist passed his hours of childhood.</p>

<p>In like manner, that marked aversion to arbitrary
power, which ever distinguished the actions and
writings of Dr. Franklin, has by himself been referred
to the sense of injustice early imprinted upon his
mind by the severe and tyrannical conduct of his
elder brother; while, at the same time, he tells us
that he was indebted for his habit through life, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
forming just estimates of the value of things, to his
having, at the age of seven years, "paid too much
for his whistle."</p>

<p>But circumstances, however disposed and happily
combined, although they may direct, can never create
genius; it is possible that Cowley might never
have been enamoured of the Muses, nor Sir Joshua
Reynolds have courted the Graces, but for the casual
circumstances recorded by the biographer; and Ferguson
might not have turned his attention to mechanical
inventions, had not an accident befallen the
roof of his father's cottage; and even Priestley, the
founder of a new and beautiful department in science,
might very probably never have been led to
think of pneumatic chemistry, had he not lived in
the vicinity of a great brewery: still, however, such
men could not have shone dimly, if true genius be
correctly defined by Dr. Johnson as "a mind of large
general powers accidentally determined to some particular
direction."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;So with Davy; his mind was
as vigorous as it was original, and no less logical
and precise than it was daring and comprehensive;
nothing was too mighty for its grasp, nothing too
minute for its observation; like the trunk of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
elephant, it could tear up the oak of the forest, or
gently pluck the acorn from its branch.</p>

<p>That circumstances in early life should have directed
such energies to a science, which requires for
its advancement all the aids of novel and bold, and
yet patient and accurate research, is one of those
fortunate events which every unprejudiced mind
will view with triumph.</p>

<p>It is surely not difficult to understand how it happened
that a mind endowed with the genius and
sensibilities of Davy, should have been directed to
the study of Chemistry and Mineralogy, when we
consider the nature and scenery of the country in
which accident had placed him. Many of his friends
and associates must have been connected with mining
speculations: "Shafts," "Cross Courses," and
"Lodes," were words familiarised to his ears; and
his native love of enquiry could not have long suffered
them to remain strangers to his understanding.
Nor could he have wandered along the rocky coast,
or have reposed for a moment to contemplate its
wild scenery, without being invited to geological
enquiry by the genius of the place; for were we to
personify the science, where could we find a more
appropriate spot for her "local habitation?" "How
often when a boy," said Davy to me, on my showing
him a drawing of the wild rock scenery of Botallack
Mine, "have I wandered about those rocks in search
of new minerals, and, when fatigued, sat down upon
the turf, and exercised my fancy in anticipations of
scientific renown!"</p>

<p>Such scenery, also, in one who possessed a quick
sensibility to the sublime forms of Nature, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
well calculated to kindle that enthusiasm which is
so essential to poetical genius; and we accordingly
learn, that he became enamoured of the Muses at a
very early age, and evinced his passion by several
poetical productions. I am assured by Dr. Batten
that, at the age of twelve years, he had finished an
epic poem, which he entitled the "Tydidiad," from
its celebrating the adventures of Diomede on his return
from the Trojan war. It is much to be regretted
that not even a fragment of this poem should
have been preserved; but Dr. Batten well remembers
that it was characterised by great freedom of invention,
vigour of description, and wildness of execution.</p>

<p>At the age of seventeen he became desperately
enamoured of a young French lady, at that time
resident at Penzance, to whom he addressed numerous
sonnets; but these, like the passion that produced
them, have long since been extinct.</p>

<p>Several of his minor productions were printed in
a work entitled the "Annual Anthology," published
in three volumes at Bristol, in 1799; two of which
were edited by Southey, and one by James Tobin;&mdash;a
work of some curiosity, independent of its merits,
as the first attempt in this country to establish an
"Annual," a species of literary composition which
has lately been made very popular and amusing.</p>

<p>These volumes have now become extremely scarce,
for which, and other reasons, I have thought it right
to place Davy's productions on record in these memoirs;
for although they are marked by the common
faults of youthful poets, they still bear the
stamp of lofty genius. There is, besides, a vein of
philosophical contemplation running through their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
composition, which may be considered as indicating
the future character and pursuit of their author;
an ardent aspiration after fame seems, even at this
early period, to have been felt in all its force, and is
expressed in many striking and beautiful passages.</p>

<p>There is still a higher motive by which I am induced
to introduce these specimens into my memoir,
that of showing the bias of his genius at this early
period, with a view to compare it with that which
displayed itself in the "last days of the philosopher."
We shall find that the bright and rosy hues of fancy
which gilded the morning of his life, and were subdued
or chased away by the more resplendent light
of maturer age, again glowed forth in the evening
of his days, and illumined the setting, as they had the
dawning of his genius.</p>

<p>His first production bears the date of 1795, and is
entitled</p>

<p>That the Genius who presided over the destinies
of Davy should have torn him from these flowery
regions of Fancy, and condemned him to labour in
the dusky caverns of the mineral kingdom, has furnished
a fruitful theme of lamentation to the band
of Poets, and to those who prefer the amusements to
the profits of life, and who cherish the hallucinations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
of the imagination rather than the truths of science.
If, however, we regret that Davy's Muse, like Proserpine,
should have been thus violently seized, and
carried off to the lower regions, as she was weaving
her native wild flowers into a garland, we may console
ourselves in knowing that, like the daughter of
Ceres, she also obtained the privilege of occasionally
revisiting her native bowers; for it will appear in
the course of these memoirs, that in the intervals of
more abstruse studies, Davy not unfrequently amused
himself with poetical composition. But, in sober
truth, is it possible that any reasonable being can
regret the course in which he has been impelled?
A great poetic Genius has said, "If Davy had not
been the first Chemist, he would have been the first
Poet of his age." Upon this question I do not feel
myself a competent judge: but where is the modern
Esau who would exchange his Bakerian Lecture for
a poem, though it should equal in design and execution
the <span class="smcap">Paradise Lost</span>?</p>

<p>As far as can be ascertained, one of the first original
experiments in Chemistry performed by him at
Penzance, was for the purpose of discovering the
quality of the air contained in the bladders of sea-weed,
in order to obtain results in support of a favourite
theory of light; and to ascertain whether, as
land vegetables are the renovators of the atmosphere
of land-animals, sea-vegetables might not be the preservers
of the equilibrium of the atmosphere of the
ocean. From these experiments he concluded, that
the different orders of the marine <em>Cryptogamia</em> were
capable of decomposing water, when assisted by the
attraction of light for oxygen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
His instruments, however, were of the rudest description,
manufactured by himself out of the motley
materials which chance threw in his way; the pots
and pans of the kitchen, and even the more sacred
vessels and professional instruments of the surgery,
were without the least hesitation or remorse put in
requisition.</p>

<p>While upon this subject, I will relate an anecdote
which was communicated to me by my late venerable
friend Mr. Thomas Giddy.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> A French vessel
having been wrecked off the Land's End, the surgeon
escaped, and found his way to Penzance; accident
brought him acquainted with Humphry Davy, who
showed him many civilities, and in return received,
as a present from the surgeon, a case of instruments
which had been saved from the ship. The contents
were eagerly turned out and examined by the young
chemist, not, however, with any professional view as
to their utility, but in order to ascertain how far they
might be convertible to experimental purposes. The
old-fashioned and clumsy glyster apparatus was
viewed with exultation, and seized in triumph!&mdash;What
reverses may not be suddenly effected by a
simple accident! so says the moralist. Reader, behold
an illustration:&mdash;in the brief space of an hour,
did this long-neglected and unobtrusive machine,
emerging from its obscurity and insignificance, figure
away in all the pomp and glory of a complicated
piece of pneumatic apparatus: nor did its fortunes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
end here; it was destined for greater things; and we
shall hereafter learn that it actually performed the
duties of an air-pump, in an original experiment on
the nature and sources of heat. The most humble
means may certainly accomplish the highest ends:
the filament of a spider's web has been used to measure
the motions of the stars; and a kite, made with
two cross sticks and a silk handkerchief, enabled the
chemical Prometheus to rob the thunder-cloud of its
lightnings; but that a worn-out instrument, such as
has been just described, should have furnished him
who was born to revolutionize the science of the age,
with the only means of enquiry at that time within
his reach, affords, it must be admitted, a very whimsical
illustration of our maxim.</p>

<p>Nor can we pass over these circumstances, without
observing how materially they must have influenced
the subsequent success of Davy as an experimentalist.
Had he, at the commencement of his career,
been furnished with all those appliances which he
enjoyed at a later period, it is more than probable
that he might never have acquired that wonderful
tact of manipulation, that ability of suggesting expedients,
and of contriving apparatus so as to meet
and surmount the difficulties which must ever beset
the philosopher in the unbeaten tracks of Science.
In this art, he certainly stands unrivalled, and, like
his prototype Scheele,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> or that pioneer of pneumatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
experimentalists, Dr. Priestley,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> he was unquestionably
indebted for his address to the circumstances
above related. There never, perhaps, was a more
striking exemplification of the adage, that "necessity
is the parent of invention."</p>

<p>It would however appear that, imperfect as must
have been his apparatus, and limited as were his resources,
his ambition very early led him to the investigation
of the most abstruse and recondite phenomena.
He was not more than seventeen when
he formed a strong opinion adverse to the general
belief in the existence of <em>caloric</em>, or the materiality
of heat.</p>

<p>As I shall hereafter have occasion to draw a parallel
between the intellectual qualities of Davy, and
those of the celebrated Dr. Black, the father of modern
chemistry, it may not be irrelevant to state, in
this place, that the subject of heat was also amongst
the first that attracted the attention of this latter
philosopher; indeed, he tells us himself, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
"can scarcely remember the time, when he had
not some idea of the disagreement of facts with
the commonly received doctrines upon this subject."
The tendency of his mind, however, was in direct
opposition to that of Davy's, for he insisted upon
the materiality of heat, and was the first to conceive
the bold idea of its being capable, like any other
substance, of entering into chemical combination
with various bodies, and of thus losing its characteristic
qualities.</p>

<p>Black's theory could not be more opposed to that
of Davy than was his conduct upon the occasion;
for, although an experiment suggested itself to his
mind, by which, as he thought, he could at once
establish the truth of his favourite doctrine, he delayed
performing it, because there did not happen
to be an ice-house in the town in which he lived.
With Davy, on the other hand, the conception and
execution of an experiment were nearly simultaneous:
no sooner, therefore, had he formed his
opinion, than his eager spirit urged him to put it to
the test.</p>

<p>Having procured a piece of clock-work, so contrived
as to be set to work in an exhausted receiver,
he added two horizontal plates of brass; the upper
one, carrying a small metallic cup to be filled with
ice, revolved in contact with the lower one. The
whole machine, resting on a plate of ice, was covered
by a glass receiver, and the air was exhausted by the
very syringe, ingeniously modified for the purpose,
with which the reader has already been made acquainted:
for, as yet, he had no air-pump, and, what
is still more worthy of notice, had never even seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
one! The machine was now set in motion, when
the ice in the small cup was soon observed to
melt; whence he inferred that this effect could alone
proceed from vibratory motion, since the whole apparatus
was insulated from all accession of material
heat, by the frozen mass below, and by the vacuum
around it.</p>

<p>The experiment was afterwards repeated with
greater care, and by means of a more refined apparatus:
it was modified in different ways; and the
results were ultimately published in an Essay, to
be hereafter noticed, "On Heat, Light, and the
Combinations of Light," which appeared in a provincial
collection of tracts, edited by Dr. Beddoes,
at Bristol.</p>

<p>Mr. Davies Gilbert, in describing the above experiment
in his late address to the Royal Society,
very justly observed that it does not at all decide
the important matter in dispute, with respect to an
ethereal or transcendental fluid; but that few young
men remote from the society of persons conversant
with science, will present themselves, who are capable
of devising any thing so ingenious.</p>

<p>Dr. Henry, in a paper published in the "Memoirs
of the Manchester Society," on entering into a review
of this and similar experiments, very truly
states, that the mode of insulation is not only imperfect,
but that, according to Count Rumford, caloric
will even pass through a Torricellian vacuum.</p>

<p>The most prominent circumstance in the history
of this period of Davy's life, is his introduction
to Mr. Davies Giddy, now Mr. Gilbert, the late
distinguished and popular President of the Royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Society. The manner in which this happened is as
curious as its result was important; and it furnishes
another very striking illustration of the power of
simple accident in directing our destinies. Mr. Gilbert's
attention was attracted to the future philosopher,
as he was carelessly swinging over the hatch,
or half gate, of Mr. Borlase's house, by the humorous
contortions into which he threw his features.
Davy, it may be remarked, when a boy, possessed a
countenance which, even in its natural state, was
very far from comely, while his round shoulders,
inharmonious voice, and insignificant manner, were
calculated to produce any thing rather than a favourable
impression: in riper years, he was what
might be called "good-looking," although, as a wit
of the day observed, his aspect was certainly of the
"Bucolic" character. The change which his person
underwent, after his promotion to the Royal Institution,
was so rapid, that, in the days of Herodotus,
it would have been attributed to nothing less than
the miraculous interposition of the Priestesses of
Helen. A person, who happened to be walking
with Mr. Gilbert upon the occasion alluded to, observed
that the extraordinary-looking boy in question
was young Davy, the Carver's son, who, he
added, was said to be fond of making chemical
experiments. "Chemical experiments!" exclaimed
Mr. Gilbert, with much surprise: "if that be the
case, I must have some conversation with him."
Mr. Gilbert, as we all know, possesses a strong perception
of character, and he therefore soon discovered
ample evidence of the boy's singular genius.
After several interviews, which confirmed him in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the opinion he had formed, he offered young Humphry
the use of his library, or any other assistance
that he might require for the pursuit of his studies;
and at the same time gave him an invitation to his
house at Tredrea, of which he frequently availed
himself.</p>

<p>During one of his visits, Mr. Gilbert accompanied
him to Hayle Copper-House, and introduced him to
Dr. Edwards, a gentleman afterwards known to the
medical profession as the chemical lecturer in the
school of St. Bartholomew's Hospital; at the time,
however, alluded to, he resided at Copper-House
with his father, and possessed a well-appointed laboratory.
The tumultuous delight which Davy expressed
on seeing, for the first time, a quantity of
chemical apparatus, hitherto only known to him
through the medium of engravings, is described by
Mr. Gilbert as surpassing all description. The air-pump
more especially fixed his attention, and he
worked its piston, exhausted the receiver, and
opened its valves, with the simplicity and joy of
a child engaged in the examination of a new and
favourite toy.</p>

<p>It is a curious circumstance, that the phenomena
resulting from the contact of iron and copper, in
the investigation of which Davy was destined to
perform so prominent a part, were very early noticed
by Mr. Edwards in this place; who found
that the flood-gates in the Port of Hayle decayed
with a rapidity wholly inexplicable, but upon the
supposition of some <em>chemical</em> action between the
metals which had not yet been clearly explained.
How little did Mr. Edwards imagine that the fact,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
which had so powerfully excited his curiosity, would
become to the youth before him, a future source of
rich and honourable discovery!</p>

<p>During the following year, an event occurred
which contributed, in no small degree, to the advancement
of Davy's prospects. Mr. Gregory Watt,
who had long been in a declining state of health,
was recommended by his physicians to reside for
some time in the West of England, and he accordingly
proceeded at once to Penzance, and took up
his abode, as a lodger and boarder, in the house of
Mrs. Davy. It may be supposed that two kindred
spirits would not be long in contracting an acquaintance
with each other; in fact, an intimacy of the
warmest nature did ultimately grow up between
them, and continue to the very moment of Mr.
Watt's premature dissolution: the origin and progress
of their friendship, however, are too curious to
be passed over without some notice.</p>

<p>Mr. Gregory Watt possessed a warm and affectionate
heart; but there was a solemn, aristocratic
coldness in his manner, which repulsed every approach
to familiarity. Davy, it has been already
stated, did not at that time possess any of those
qualifications, in person or manner, which are calculated
to produce favourable prepossessions. It may,
therefore, be readily imagined how Mr. Watt must
have felt, on finding the son of his landlady familiarly
addressing him on subjects of metaphysics and
poetry. By one of those strange perversions which
have so frequently led great men to conceal the
peculiarity of their talents, and to rest their claims
to notice and respect upon qualifications which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
possessed only in an inferior degree, Davy sought
to ingratiate himself with Mr. Watt by metaphysical
discussions; but, instead of the admiration, he
excited the disgust of his hearer. It was by mere
accident that an allusion was first made to chemistry,
when Davy flippantly observed, that he would
undertake to demolish the French theory in half an
hour. He had touched the chord: the interest of
Mr. Watt was excited,&mdash;he conversed with Davy
upon his chemical pursuits,&mdash;he was at once astonished
and delighted at his sagacity,&mdash;the barrier of
ice was removed, and they became attached friends.</p>

<p>Mr. Wedgwood, and his brother Thomas, also
spent a winter at Penzance; and I have reason to
believe that their friendship was of substantial benefit
to Davy.</p>

<p>Before I attend the progress of our philosopher
to the next scene of life, or proceed to detail the
circumstances connected with his departure from
Penzance, I must relate the following anecdote.&mdash;Until
the formation of the Geological Society
of London occasioned the introduction of more extended
and sounder views into the science, geologists
were divided into two great rival sects,&mdash;into
Neptunists and Plutonists: the one affirming that
the globe was exclusively indebted for its present
form and arrangement to the agency of water; the
other, admitting to a certain extent the operation
of water, but maintaining the utter impossibility of
explaining the consolidation of the strata without
the intervention of fire. Every geologist felt bound
to side with the one or the other of these contending
parties, for neutrality was held as disgraceful as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
though the law of Solon had been in active operation.
I shall not easily forget the din and fury of
this elemental war, as it raged in Edinburgh when
I was a student in that University; even the mineral
dealers, who, like the artisans of a neutral city,
sold arms and ammunition to both sides, still defended
their own opinions with party fury. It was
amusing to observe the triumph and dismay which,
by turns, animated and depressed each side, as the
discovery of a new fact, or a fresh specimen, appeared
to give a preponderance to the doctrine of fire or
water. The fact of so large a portion of the strata
being found in the state of a carbonate was advanced
by the Neptunists as an unanswerable argument
against igneous agency: the dismay therefore
which this sect received upon the discovery of Sir
James Hall, that under the combined forces of heat
and compression, carbonate of lime might be fused,
was only equalled by the excessive joy excited in
the contending party. We may form some notion
of the high importance attached to this discovery,
when we learn that its author applied to the
Government for a flag of truce to convey illustrative
specimens to the Continental philosophers.</p>

<p>It so happened, that the Professors of Oxford
and Cambridge ranged themselves under opposite
banners: Dr. Beddoes was a violent and uncompromising
Plutonist, while Professor Hailstone was
as decided a Neptunist. The rocks of Cornwall,
and their granitic veins, had been appealed to, as
affording evidence upon the subject; and the two
Professors, who, although adverse in opinion, were
united in friendship, determined to proceed together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
to the field of dispute, each hoping that he might
thus convince the other of his error, and cure him
of his heresy. The belligerents arrived at Penzance,
and in company with their mutual friend,
Mr. Davies Gilbert, examined the coast, and procured
specimens with pretty much the same spirit
of selection as a schoolboy consults his Gradus, not
for an epithet of any meaning, but for one which
best suits his measure; and having made drawings,
disputed obvious appearances, rendered that which
was clear to the senses, confused to the understanding,
and what was already confused, ten times more
obscure, they returned, the opinion of each, as might
easily have been anticipated, having been strengthened
by the ordeal: the one protesting that the
very aspect of the shivered slate was sufficient to
prove that the globe must have been roasted to
rags; the other, with equal plausibility, declaring
that there was not a tittle of evidence to show that
the watery solvent had ever even simmered. Such,
in fact, must ever be the case, when philosophers
examine the same subject under such different impressions,
and in such opposite points of view; like
the two knights who could not agree respecting the
colour of the shield, only because each saw a different
side of it.</p>

<p>Rocks, it is said, have flinty hearts, and certain
it is that, upon this occasion, Cornwall did not
afford that assistance against the Neptunists, which
the Oxford Professor had sought with so much zeal
and confidence; but if deferred revenge had, as we
are told is generally the case, been put out at compound
interest, and Beddoes had exacted its dues
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
with more than judaical rigour, it must be allowed
that Cornwall, by placing Davy at his disposal,
would have fully cancelled all demands.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Plutonian Beddoes, erst, in spiteful ire,</div>
<div class="line">To see a <em>Hailstone</em> mock his central fire,</div>
<div class="line">A mighty spirit raised, by whose device</div>
<div class="line">We now burn <span class="smcap">Hailstones</span>, and set fire to Ice.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Before quitting this subject, it is but justice to
advert to the progress which Geology has made
since the turbulence of this contest has subsided;
it has grown strong in facts, and is daily increasing
its stores. It has been wisely said by one of the
ancient Poets, that in vehement disputes, not only
the persons engaged, but every one who is at all
interested, must suffer; not only the combatants,
but the spectators of the combat,&mdash;for it is difficult
to apprehend truth while it is the subject of angry
contest.</p>

<p>To return to the narrative.&mdash;Upon Beddoes establishing
the "Pneumatic Institution" at Bristol, he
required an assistant who might superintend the
necessary experiments in the laboratory; and Mr.
Gilbert proposed Davy as a person fully competent
to fill the situation. The young candidate had already
produced a very favourable impression upon
Dr. Beddoes, by his experiments upon Heat and
Light, which he had some time before transmitted
to him through the hands of his friend Mr. Gregory
Watt. This fact may be collected from a note
appended by Dr. Beddoes to Davy's paper subsequently
published in the first volume of the West
Country Contributions, in which the Doctor says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
"My first knowledge of Mr. Davy arose from a
letter written in April 1798, containing an account
of his researches on Heat and Light." The rest is
told in the letters which passed on this occasion
between Dr. Beddoes and Mr. Gilbert, and from
which I shall make such extracts as may be necessary
to complete the history of a transaction of
much interest and importance.</p>

<p>In a letter dated July 4, 1798, Dr. Beddoes says,
"I am glad that Mr. Davy has impressed you as he
has me. I have long wished to write to you about
him, for I think I can open a more fruitful field of
investigation than any body else. Is it not also his
most direct road to fortune? Should he not bring
out a favourable result, he may still exhibit talents
for investigation, and entitle himself to public confidence
more effectually than by any other mode.
He must be maintained, but the fund will not furnish
a salary from which a man can lay up any
thing. He must also devote his time for two or
three years to the investigation. I wish you would
converse with him upon the subject. No doubt
he has received my two last letters. I am sorry
I cannot at this moment specify a yearly sum, nor
can I say with certainty whether all the subscribers
will accede to my plan; most of them will, I doubt
not. I have written to the principal ones, and will
lose no time in sounding them all."</p>

<p>In a second letter of the 18th of July, we find the
following observations. "I have received a letter
from Mr. Davy since I wrote to you. He has
oftener than once mentioned a <em>genteel maintenance</em>,
as a preliminary to his being employed to superintend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
the Pneumatic Hospital. I fear the funds
will not allow an ample salary; he must, however,
be maintained. I can attach no idea to the epithet
<em>genteel</em>, but perhaps all difficulties would vanish in
conversation; at least, I think your conversing with
Mr. Davy will be a more likely way of smoothing
difficulties, than our correspondence. It appears to
me, that this appointment will bear to be considered
as a part of Mr. Davy's medical education, and that
it will be a great saving of expense to him. It may
also be the foundation of a lucrative reputation;
and certainly nothing on my part shall be wanting
to secure to him the credit he may deserve.
He does not undertake to discover cures for this
or that disease; he may acquire just applause by
bringing out clear, though negative results. During
my journeys into the country, I have picked
up a variety of important and curious facts from
different practitioners. This has suggested to me
the idea of collecting and publishing such facts as
this part of the country will, from time to time,
afford. If I could procure chemical experiments,
that bore any relation to organised nature, I would
insert them. If Mr. Davy does not dislike this
method of publishing his experiments, I would
gladly place them at the head of my first volume,
but I wish not that he should make any sacrifice
of judgment or inclination."</p>

<p>It remains only to be stated, that Mr. Gilbert
kindly undertook the negotiation, and completed
it to the satisfaction of all the principal parties.
Mrs. Davy yielded to her son's wishes, and Mr.
Borlase very generously surrendered his indenture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
with an endorsement to the following effect,&mdash;that
he freely gave up the indenture, on account of the
singularly promising talents which Mr. Davy had
displayed.</p>

<p>His old and valued friend Mr. Tonkin, however,
not only expressed his disapprobation of this scheme,
but was so vexed and irritated at having his favourite
plan of fixing Davy in his native town as a
Surgeon, thus thwarted, that he actually altered his
will, and revoked the legacy of his house which he
had previously bequeathed him. Mr. Tonkin died
on the 24th of December 1801; so that, although
he lived long enough to witness Davy's appointment
to the Royal Institution, he could never have
anticipated the elevation to which his genius and
talents ultimately raised him.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of October in the year 1798, Davy
quitted Penzance, before he had attained his twentieth
year. Mr. Gilbert well remembers meeting
him upon his journey to Bristol, and breakfasting
with him at Okehampton, on the 4th of October.
He was in the highest spirits, and in that frame
of mind in which a man of ardent imagination identifies
every successful occurrence with his own fortunes;
his exhilaration, therefore, was not a little
heightened by the arrival of the mail-coach from
London, covered with laurels and ribbons, and
bringing the news, so cheering to every English
heart, of <span class="smcap">Nelson's</span> glorious victory of the <span class="smcap">Nile</span>.</p>

<p>Having concluded the early history of the subject
of these memoirs, and conducted it to that memorable
day on which he left his native town, and
bursting from obscurity, prepared to enter upon a
wider field of usefulness and honour, I shall accompany
him in his progress; and with the honest
desire of affording instruction as well as amusement,&mdash;for
history is useful only as it holds up
the mirror of Truth,&mdash;I shall continue to point
out the various circumstances that may have contributed
to his success and scientific renown; and
to offer such occasional reflections as may be likely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
to illustrate not only the superficial peculiarities
which constitute the light and shade of character,
but those deeper varieties of mind, upon which the
superiority of intellect may be supposed to depend.</p>

<p>After all, the great end of biography is not to be
found, as some would seem to imagine, in a series of
dates, or in a collection of gossiping anecdotes and
table-talk, which, instead of lighting up and vivifying
the features, hang as a cloud of dust upon
the portrait; but it is to be found in an analysis
of human genius, and in the developement of those
elements of the mind, to whose varied combinations,
and nicely adjusted proportions, the mental
habits, and intellectual peculiarities of distinguished
men may be readily referred.</p>

<p>It has been stated that an arrangement had been
concluded between Dr. Beddoes and Davy: it is
but an act of justice to say, that it was of a liberal
and honourable description; and let me also add in
this place, that no sooner had Davy found himself
in a situation which secured for him the necessaries
of life, than he renounced all claims upon his
paternal property, in favour of his mother and
sisters.</p>

<p>By acceding to the proposal of Dr. Beddoes, he
never intended to abandon the profession in which
he had embarked; on the contrary, he persevered
in his determination to study and graduate at Edinburgh,
and his patron promised that every opportunity
should be afforded him at Bristol for seeing
medical practice: this part of the arrangement,
however, was voluntarily abandoned by him, for
he soon became so absorbed by the labours of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
laboratory, as to leave little leisure for the clinical
studies of the hospital.</p>

<p>The Pneumatic Institution was established for
the purpose of investigating the medical powers of
factitious airs or gases; and to Davy was assigned
the office of superintending the various experiments.</p>

<p>It is now generally acknowledged, that the Art
of Physic has not derived any direct advantage
from the application of a class of agents which, undoubtedly,
held forth the fairest promise of benefit;
but it is too frequently the case, that in physic,
theory and experience are in open hostilities with
each other. The gases are now never employed in
the treatment of disease, except by a few crafty or
ignorant empirics, whose business it is to enrich
themselves by playing on the credulity of mankind:
indeed, we may say of popular remedies in
general what M. de Lagrange has so wittily said
of popular prejudices, that they are the cast-off
clothes of philosophers, in which the rabble dress
themselves.</p>

<p>The investigation, however, into the nature and
composition of the gases paved the way to some
new and important discoveries in science; so that,
to borrow a Baconian metaphor, although our philosophers
failed in obtaining the treasure for which
they so eagerly dug, they at least, by turning up
and pulverizing the soil, rendered it fertile. The
ingenuity of the chemist will for ever remain on
record; the phantoms of the physicians have vanished
into air.</p>

<p>Davy was now constantly engaged in the prosecution
of new experiments, in the conception of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
which, as he himself informs us, he was greatly
aided by the conversation and advice of Dr. Beddoes.
He was also occasionally assisted by Mr.
William Clayfield, a gentleman ardently attached
to chemical pursuits, and whose name is not unknown
in the annals of science; indeed, it appears
that to him he was indebted for the invention of
a mercurial air-holder, by which he was enabled to
collect and measure the various gases submitted to
examination. He had also the advantages of some
society of a highly intellectual cast: it is sufficient
to mention the names of Edgeworth and James
Tobin.</p>

<p>In reply to a letter of enquiry which was lately
addressed to her, Miss Edgeworth observes, that
"her father possessed much influence over Davy's
mind;" and that "when he was a very young man
at Clifton, unknown to fame, Mr. Edgeworth early
distinguished and warmly admired his talents, and
gave him much counsel, which sunk deep into his
mind."</p>

<p>The present Lord Durham and his brother were
also resident in the house of Dr. Beddoes, not only
for their education, but for the benefit of his professional
superintendence. Besides those who were
residing at Clifton, the most distinguished in the
circles of science and literature paid passing visits
to Dr. Beddoes; with many of whom Davy contracted
an acquaintance, with some an intimacy,
and with a few a solid and permanent friendship.
In examining the individuals composing this latter
class, we find them differing so widely from each
other in character and pursuit, that we are led to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
enquire upon what principles of affinity his regards
could possibly have been attracted&mdash;the truth is,
that there was more than one avenue to his heart;
and the philosopher, the poet, the physician, the
philanthropist, and the sportsman, found each, upon
different terms, a more or less ready access to its
recesses. The chemist who would aspire to his
favour, could alone obtain it by laborious application
and novel research; the philanthropist, by the
practicability of his schemes for improving society,
and increasing the sum of its happiness; but the
fisherman instantly caught his affections by a hook
and line. To be a fly-fisher was, in his opinion,
to possess the capabilities of intellectual distinction,
although circumstances might not have conspired
to call them into action; whilst a proficiency in this
art, when exhibited by an individual otherwise distinguished,
gave him an additional claim to his
attention and regard. The stern courage of Nelson,
tempered as it was with all the kindly feelings of
humanity, was sufficient to excite in the breast of
Davy the most enthusiastic admiration; but the
circumstance of his having been a fly-fisher, and
continued the sport, even with his left hand, threw,
in his opinion, a still brighter halo around his
character.</p>

<p>No one who knew him can accuse him of inconstancy
in his friendships: amidst the excitements
of his station, and the abstractions incident to his
pursuits, he might not always have shown those
little attentions which are received by the world
as the indications of personal regard; but his heart
beat not less warmly on that account: when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
flame of affection had been once kindled, it burnt
with a pure and steady light through life. This
will be readily seen in the letters addressed to his
several early friends, more especially to Mr. Poole
of Nether Stowey, in Somersetshire, and to Mr.
Clayfield of Bristol, from which I shall have occasion
to present some interesting extracts.</p>

<p>Those who had become acquainted with him in
early life, and were enabled to watch the whole
progress of his career from obscurity to the highest
pinnacle of fame, have declared that his extraordinary
talents never at any period excited greater
astonishment and admiration than during his short
residence at Bristol. His simplicity of mind and
manner was also at this time truly delightful.
He scarcely knew the names of our best authors,
much less read any of their works; yet upon
topics of moral philosophy and metaphysics he
would enter into discussion with acknowledged
scholars, and not only delight them with the native
energy of his mind, but instruct them by the novelty
and truth of his conceptions. Mr. Coleridge
lately expressed to me the astonishment he felt,
very shortly after his introduction to him, on hearing
him maintain an argument upon some abstruse
subject with a gentleman equally distinguished for
the extent of his erudition, and for the talent of
rendering it available for illustration;&mdash;the contrast
was most striking&mdash;it was the fresh and native
wild flower, opposed to the elaborate exotic of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hortus Siccus</i>!</p>

<p>During this period he occasionally visited his
friend Mr. Gregory Watt, at Birmingham; at which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
place his ambition was constantly excited by intercourse
with congenial minds; and his letters to his
mother and relations represent him as rejoicing in
the success of his experiments, and as delighting
in his association with kindred genius; but always
casting a longing, lingering thought on the scenes
of his boyhood, he spoke with joyful anticipation
of the period at which he proposed to revisit his
mother and family.</p>

<p>That he still continued to regard the practice of
physic as the great end and object of all his pursuits,
is evident from one of these letters, written in
1799, in which he says, "Philosophy, Chemistry,
and Medicine, are my profession."</p>

<p>On the 1st of December 1799 he visited London
for the first time, and remained about a fortnight;
the friends with whom he associated upon
this occasion were Coleridge, Southey, Gregory
Watt, Underwood, James and John Tobin, Thomson,
and Clayfield; all of whom vied with each
other in their exertions to render his visit agreeable,
conducting him to such persons and places as were
deemed worthy of his notice.</p>

<p>Of all the letters placed at my disposal, those
addressed to his early friend and patron, Mr. Davies
Gilbert, are, in my judgment, the most interesting:
it is true, that as specimens of epistolary
style they have but slender pretensions, and
are far less pleasing than those written to Mr. Poole
and others, in later life; but let it be remembered
that, as yet, their writer had never enjoyed the
advantages of literary correspondence. For the
defects, however, of style, there is more than sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
compensation; they speak from the heart;&mdash;they
carry with them internal evidence of the honest
simplicity of his mind, and they throw a light upon
the peculiarities of his genius, which without such
aid might be less perfectly understood; above all,
they evince an ardour which no difficulties could
repress, and a confidence which no failures could
extinguish. We clearly discern from his first letters,
that he entered upon his career of experiment
with an almost chivalrous feeling, flushed with the
consciousness of native strength, and exulting in
the prospect of destined achievements.</p>

<p>I am aware that there are those who still object,
with Dr. Sprat, to the practice of publishing letters
which were never intended for the public eye, and I
experience the inconvenience, while I respect the
delicacy, of such an opinion. I confess, on my own
part, I have always considered, with Mr. Mason,
that the objections urged by the learned historian of
the Royal Society are wholly untenable. He talks
of "the souls of men thus appearing undressed, or
in a habit too negligent to go abroad in the streets,
although they might be seen by a few in a chamber."
But the undress he would condemn, is the
nakedness of Truth&mdash;the negligent attire, the simple
and unadorned expression of those natural and significant
traits, whose value incomparably exceeds the
premeditated and artificial exhibitions of mind and
manner. "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nam in ingenio quoque sicut in agro,
quanquam alia diu serantur atque elaborantur, gratiora
tamen quæ sua sponte nascuntur.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
I cannot but suspect that Dr. Sprat was, upon this
occasion, more anxious to display a metaphor, than
to illustrate a truth. I have often thought a very
curious book might be written to show how greatly,
both in physics and in morals, the progress of truth
has been retarded, and the judgment of men warped,
by the abuse of metaphors; the most correct of
which can be nothing more than the image of Truth
reflected, as it were, from a mirror, and consequently
liable to all the delusions of our mental optics. The
figure by which Nature was represented as "<em>abhorring
a vacuum</em>," kept us in ignorance of the true
theory of the pump for two thousand years after the
discovery of the weight, or gravity, of the atmosphere;<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
and the unfortunate P. L. Courier positively
owed his conviction to a metaphor in the Judge's
charge&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un écrìt plein de poison.</i>"&mdash;Well might the
defendant exclaim, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sauvez-nous de la Metaphore!</i>"</p>

<p>The first of the letters to which I have alluded
appears to have been written rather more than five
weeks after his arrival at Clifton.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO DAVIES GIDDY, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Clifton, November 12, 1798.</p>

<p class="opening">DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>I have purposely delayed writing until I could
communicate to you some intelligence of importance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
concerning the Pneumatic Institution. The speedy
execution of the plan will, I think, interest you,
both as a subscriber and a friend to science and mankind.
The present subscription is, we suppose,
nearly adequate to the purpose of investigating the
medicinal powers of factitious airs; it still continues
to increase, and we may hope for the ability of pursuing
the investigation to its full extent. We are
negotiating for a house in Dowrie Square, the proximity
of which to Bristol, and its general situation
and advantages, render it very suitable to the purpose.
The funds will, I suppose, enable us to provide
for eight or ten patients in the hospital, and for
as many out of it as we can procure.</p>

<p>We shall try the gases in every possible way.
They may be condensed by pressure and rarefied
by heat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quere</i>,&mdash;would not a powerful injecting
syringe,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> furnished with two valves, one opening
into an air-holder and the other into the breathing
chamber, answer the purpose of compression better
than any other apparatus? Can you not, from your
extensive stores of philosophy, furnish us with some
hints on this subject? May not the non-respirable
gases furnish a class of different stimuli? of which
the <em>oxymuriatic acid gas</em> would stand the highest, if
we might judge from its effects on the lungs; then,
probably, <em>gaseous oxyd of azote</em>, and <em>hydro-carbonate</em>.</p>

<p>I suppose you have not heard of the discovery of
the native <em>sulphate of strontian</em> in England. I shall
perhaps surprise you by stating that we have it in
large quantities here. It had long been mistaken for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
<em>sulphate of barytes</em>, till our friend Clayfield, on endeavouring
to procure the <em>muriate of barytes</em> from it
by decomposition, detected the strontian. We opened
a fine vein of it about a fortnight ago, at the Old
Passage near the mouth of the Severn. It was embodied
in limestone and gypsum, the outside of the
vein, a striated mass; the internal parts finely crystallized
in cubes, of the Sp. Gr. 4·1. Clayfield has
been working at it for some time. We have persuaded
him to publish his analysis in the first volume
of the Western Physical Collection.</p>

<p>I have made with him the phosphuret of barytes
and of strontian: they possess, in common with that
of lime, the property of producing phosphorized hydrogen
gas; the phosphuret of strontian, it appears,
in a more eminent degree.</p>

<p>We have likewise attempted to decompose the
boracic and muriatic acids, by passing phosphorus, in
vapour, through muriate, and borate of lime, heated
red. Phosphate of lime was found in the experiment
on the boracic acid; but, as no pneumatic
apparatus was employed, the experiment was uncertain.
We shall repeat them next week.</p>

<p>We are printing in Bristol the first volume of the
'West Country Collection,' which will, I suppose, be
out in the beginning of January.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beddoes hopes that Miss Giddy received her
letter, and desires me to certify that she wrote
almost immediately after the reception of her epistle.
She is as good, amiable, and elegant as when you
saw her. Believe me, dear Sir, with affection and
respect,</p>

<p class="signature">Truly your's,<br />
<span class="smcap j2">Humphry Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
The work announced in the above letter was published
in the commencement of the year 1799, under
the title of "Contributions to Physical and Medical
Knowledge, principally from the West of England;
collected by Thomas Beddoes, M.D."</p>

<p>The first two hundred pages, constituting very
nearly half the volume, are the composition of Davy,
and consist of essays "On Heat, Light, and the
Combinations of Light." "On Phos-oxygen, or
Oxygen and its Combinations;" and "On the
Theory of Respiration."</p>

<p>His first essay commences with an experiment, in
order to show that light is not, as Lavoisier supposed,
a modification, or an effect, of heat, but matter
of a peculiar kind, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>, which, when
moving through space, or in a state of projection, is
capable of becoming the source of a numerous class
of our sensations.</p>

<p>A small gunlock was armed with an excellent
flint, and, on being snapped in an exhausted receiver,
did not produce any light. The experiment
was repeated in carbonic acid, and with a similar
result. Small particles were in each case separated
from the steel, which, on microscopic examination,
evidently appeared to have undergone fusion.
Whence Davy argued, that light cannot be caloric
in a state of projection, or it must have been produced
in these experiments, where heat existed to
an extent sufficient to fuse steel. Nor, that it can
be, as some have supposed, a vibration of the imaginary
fluid ether; for, granting the existence of
such a fluid, it must have been present in the receiver.
If, then, light be neither caloric in a state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
projection, nor the vibration of an imaginary ether,
it must, he says, be a substance <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>.</p>

<p>With regard to caloric, his opinion that it is not,
like light, material, has been already noticed. In
the present essay he maintains the proposition by
the same method of reasoning as that by which he
attempts to establish the materiality of light, and
which mathematicians have termed the "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad
absurdum</i>."</p>

<p>In his chapter on "Light and its Combinations,"
he indulges in speculations of the wildest nature,
although it must be confessed that he has infused
an interest into them which might almost be called
dramatic. They are certainly highly characteristic
of that enlightened fancy, which was perpetually on
the wing, and whose flight, when afterwards tempered
and directed by judgment, enabled him to
abstract the richest treasures from the recesses of
abstract truth.</p>

<p>Taking it for granted that caloric has no existence
as a material body, or, in other words, that the
phenomena of repulsion do not depend upon the
agency of a peculiar fluid, and that, on the contrary,
light is a subtle fluid acting on our organs of vision
<em>only when in a state of repulsive projection</em>, he proceeds
to examine the French theory of combustion;
the defects of which he considers to arise from the
assumption of the imaginary fluid <em>caloric</em>, and the
total neglect of <em>light</em>. He conceives that the light
evolved during combustion previously existed in
the oxygen gas, which he therefore proposes for the
future to call <span class="smcap">PHOS-OXYGEN</span>.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
In following up this question, he would seem
to consider Light as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anima Mundi</i>, diffusing
through the universe not only organization, but
even animation and perception.</p>

<p><em>Phos-oxygen</em> he considers as capable of combining
with additional proportions of Light, and of thus
becoming '<em>luminated Phos-oxygen!</em>'&mdash;from the decomposition
of which, and the consequent liberation
of light, he seeks to explain many of the most recondite
phenomena of Nature.</p>

<p>We cannot but admire the eagerness with which
he enlists known facts into his service, and the boldness
with which he ranges the wilds of creation in
search of analogies for the support and illustration
of his views. He imagines that the <em>Phos-oxygen</em>,
when thus <em>luminated</em>, must necessarily have its specific
gravity considerably diminished by the combination,
and that it will therefore occupy the higher
regions of the atmosphere; hence, he says, it is that
combustion takes place at the tops of mountains at
a lower temperature than in the plains, and with a
greater liberation of light. The hydrogen which is
disengaged from the surface of the earth, he supposes,
will rise until it comes into contact with this
<em>luminated Phos-oxygen</em>, when, by its attracting the
oxygen to form water, the light will be set free,
and give origin to the phenomena of fiery meteors
at a great altitude.</p>

<p>The phenomenon termed '<em>Phosphorescence</em>,' or
that luminous appearance which certain bodies exhibit
after exposure to heat, is attributed by this</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
theory to the light, which may be supposed to quit
such substances as soon as its particles have acquired
repulsive motion by elevation of temperature.</p>

<p>The Electric Fluid is considered as Light in a
condensed state, or, in other words, in that peculiar
state in which it is not supplied with a repulsive
motion sufficiently energetic to impart projection
to its particles; for, he observes, that its chemical
action upon bodies is similar to that of Light; and
when supplied with repulsive motion by friction, or
by the contact of bodies from which it is capable of
subtracting it, it loses the projectile form, and becomes
perceptible as Light. It is extremely probable,
he adds, that the great quantity of this fluid
almost everywhere diffused over our earth is produced
by the condensation of Light, in consequence
of the subtraction of its repulsive motion by black
and dark bodies; while it may again recover the
projectile force by the repulsive motion of the poles,
caused by the revolution of the earth on its axis,
and thus appear again in the state of sensible light;
and hence the phenomenon of the <em>Aurora Borealis</em>,
or Northern Lights.</p>

<p>In considering the theory of Respiration, he supposes
that <em>phos-oxygen</em> combines with the venous
blood without decomposition; but that, on reaching
the brain, the light is liberated in the form of Electricity,
which he believes to be identical with the
nervous fluid. On this supposition, sensations and
ideas are nothing more than motions of the nervous
ether; or light exciting the medullary substance of
the nerves and brain into sensitive action!</p>

<p>He thinks it would be worth while to try, by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
very sensible electrometer, whether an insulated
muscle, when stimulated into action, would not give
indications of the liberation of electric fluid, although
he suspects that in man the quantity is probably too
small, and too slowly liberated, to be ascertainable.
In the torpedo, and in some other animals, however,
it is unquestionably given out perceptibly during
animal action.</p>

<p>When any considerable change takes place in
the organic matter of the body, so as to destroy the
powers of life, new chemical attractions and repulsive
motions take place, and the different principles
of which the body is composed enter into new combinations.
In this process, which is called putrefaction,
Davy, in pursuance of this theory, thinks that
in land-animals the latent light of the system enters
into new combinations with oxygen and nitrogen,
but that in fish no such combinations occur, and
hence the luminous appearance which accompanies
their putrefaction.</p>

<p>Such is the outline of these extraordinary Essays.
They stand upon record, and therefore, as a faithful
biographer, I was bound to notice them; nor are
they devoid of interest or instruction: I am not
quite sure that, amidst all the meteors of his fancy,
there may not be a gleam of truth. I allude to his
theory of Respiration: it certainly does not square
with the physiological opinions of the day; nor did
that of Newton, when he conjectured that water
might contain an inflammable element; but it was
the refraction of a great truth, at that time below
the horizon.</p>

<p>It was a very ancient opinion, that life, being in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
its own nature aëriform, is under the necessity of
renewing itself by inspiring the air. Modern chemistry,
by teaching us the nature of the atmosphere,
has dispelled many fanciful theories of its action,
but it has not yet explained why respiration, the
first and last act of life,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> cannot be suspended, even
for a minute, without the extinction of vitality.
When we reflect upon this fact, it is scarcely possible
not to believe that the function has been ordained
for some greater purpose than that of removing
a portion of carbon from the circulating blood.
Is it unreasonable to conclude that some principle is
thus imparted, which is too subtle to be long retained
in our vessels, and too important to be dispensed
with, even for the shortest period? "I offer this
opinion," as Montaigne says, "not as being good,
but as being my own."</p>

<p>By these observations, I am not to be supposed as
wishing, for a moment, to uphold the wild hypotheses
which I have just related; it must be admitted
that the theory of <em>phos-oxygen</em> and <em>luminated phos-oxygen</em>
has scarcely a parallel in extravagance and
absurdity; and I happen to know that, in after life,
Davy bitterly regretted that he had so committed
himself; any allusion to the subject became a source
of painful irritation. It is to be remarked, that in
every course of lectures, although Davy did not
refer to these theories, he frequently alluded to the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
unphilosophic spirit that had given origin to them;
as if he had imposed upon himself this penance as
an atonement for his early follies. The following
note was taken at one of his lectures:&mdash;"After what
has been said, it will be useless to enter upon an
examination of any of those theories, which, assuming
for their foundation the connexion of life with
respiration, have attempted to prove that oxygen is
the principle of life, and that the wonderful and
mysterious phenomena of perception arise from the
action of common gravitating substances upon each
other. Such theories are the dreams of misemployed
genius, which the light of experiment and
observation has never conducted to truth, and are
merely a collection of terms derived from known
phenomena, and applied by loose analogies of language
to unknown things."</p>

<p>The reader, however, will be disposed to treat
him with all tenderness when he remembers that the
author of these Essays was barely eighteen years of
age. If blame is to fall on any one, let it fall on
Dr. Beddoes, who never should have sanctioned the
publication: had he curbed the ardent and untamed
imagination of the young philosopher, he would have
acted the part of a wise man and of a kind friend.
But the truth is, that much as Davy needed the
bridle, Beddoes<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> required it still more; for, notwithstanding
his talents, he was as little fitted for a
Mentor as a weathercock for a compass; and had it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
not been for the ascendency which Davy gained
over his mind, the ardour of his temperament would
have continually urged him beyond the bounds
of reason.</p>

<p>Caught by the loosest analogies, he would arrive
at a conclusion without examining all the conditions
of his problem. In the exercise of his profession,
therefore, he was frequently led to prescribe plans
which he felt it necessary to retract the next hour.
His friend Mr. T&mdash;&mdash; had occasion to consult him
upon the case of his wife: the Doctor prescribed a
new remedy; but, in the course of the day he returned
in haste, and begged that, before Mrs. T&mdash;&mdash;
took the medicine, its effect might be tried on a dog!</p>

<p>The following anecdote, which was lately communicated
to me by Mr. Coleridge, will not only
illustrate a trait of character, but furnish a salutary
lesson to the credulous patron of empirics. As soon
as the powers of nitrous oxide were discovered, Dr.
Beddoes at once concluded that it must necessarily
be a specific for paralysis. A patient was selected
for the trial, and the management of it was entrusted
to Davy. Previous to the administration of the
gas, he inserted a small pocket thermometer under
the tongue of the patient, as he was accustomed to
do upon such occasions, to ascertain the degree of
animal temperature, with a view to future comparison.
The paralytic man, wholly ignorant of the
nature of the process to which he was to submit,
but deeply impressed, from the representations of
Dr. Beddoes, with the certainty of its success, no
sooner felt the thermometer between his teeth than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
he concluded that the <em>talisman</em> was in full operation,
and in a burst of enthusiasm declared that he
already experienced the effects of its benign influence
throughout his whole body:&mdash;the opportunity
was too tempting to be lost&mdash;Davy cast an
intelligent glance at Mr. Coleridge, and desired the
patient to renew his visit on the following day,
when the same ceremony was again performed, and
repeated every succeeding day for a fortnight, the
patient gradually improving during that period,
when he was dismissed as cured, no other application
having been used than that of the thermometer.
Dr. Beddoes, from whom the circumstances of
the case had been intentionally concealed, saw in
the restoration of the patient the confirmation of his
opinion, and the fulfilment of his most ardent hope&mdash;Nitrous
Oxide was a specific remedy for Paralysis!
"It were criminal to retard the general promulgation
of so important a discovery; it were cruel to
delay the communication of the fact until the publication
of another volume of his '<em>Contributions</em>;' the
periodical magazines were too slow in their rate of
travelling,&mdash;a flying pamphlet would be more expeditious;
paragraphs in the newspapers; circulars to
the hospitals:"&mdash;such were the reflections and plans
which successively agitated the physician's mind,
when his eyes were opened to the unwelcome truth
by Davy's confessing the delusion that had been
practised.</p>

<p>A short time after the publication of the first
volume of the "Contributions," Davy addressed to
his friend the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TO DAVIES GIDDY, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Clifton, Feb. 22, 1799.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;for I love you too well to call
you by a more ceremonious name,&mdash;I have delayed
writing to you from day to day, expecting that
some of our experiments would produce results
worthy of communication. Since I received your
last very acceptable letter, I have been chiefly employed
in pursuing the experiments on Heat, Light,
Respiration, &amp;c. Of these experiments I shall give
you no account, as you will see them in print. I
sent you a copy of my Essays last week; if you
have not received them, I trust you will find them
at my mother's, or at Mr. Tonkin's.</p>

<p>In the same parcel were two small packets, one
from Mrs. Beddoes for your father, the other for
Miss Giddy from Mrs. Willoughby. About a fortnight
ago I sent a few chemical instruments to Mr.
Penneck of Penzance; and inclosed with them were
specimens of the different varieties of sulphate of
strontian addressed to you. If you have not received
them, you will get them by sending to Mr.
Penneck.</p>

<p>On looking over a box of minerals last week,
which was sent to Dr. Beddoes from Cumberland, I
found two very fine specimens of sulphate of strontian,
marked by the collector <em>Laminated Shorl</em>. I
suspect this mineral is not scarce in calcareous countries;
it is, I dare say, often mistaken for sulphate
of barytes.</p>

<p>I have succeeded in combining strontian with the
oxygenated muriatic acid. This salt possesses most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
astonishing properties;<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> you will find an account of
them in my Essay.</p>

<p>When you have perused my papers, I shall be
very much obliged to you for a criticism upon
them. When I left Penzance, I was quite an infant
in speculation,&mdash;I knew very little of Light or
Heat. I am now as much convinced of the non-existence
of caloric, as I am of the existence of
light. Independent of the experiments which appear
to demonstrate its non-existence directly, and
of which you will find an account in my Essay, the
consideration of certain phenomena leads me to suppose
that there would be no difficulty in proving
its non-existence by reasoning. These considerations
have occurred to me since the publication of
the work. I could now render it much more perfect;
but I hope soon to complete the investigation
of the combinations of Light, and to produce a much
more perfect work on the subject. I shall be infinitely
obliged to you for any hints or observations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
as far as the detection of errors of any kind, for it is
no flattery to say that I pay greater deference to
your opinion than to that of any other philosopher.</p>

<p>We intend next week to endeavour to ascertain,
by the aid of a delicate balance, the quantities of
Light liberated in different combustive processes.
That there is a deficiency of weight, I am convinced
from many experiments.</p>

<p>The experiments on Light, &amp;c. have prevented
me from attempting the decomposition of the undecompounded
acids. We have ordered an apparatus
at the glass-house for this purpose, and I hope next
week we shall be able to carry on the investigation.
Two modes of effecting these decompositions have
occurred to me:&mdash;first, to bring phosphorus or sulphur,
in the gaseous state, in contact with the acid
gases in a tube heated intensely; secondly, to send
sulphur in the gaseous state through muriate of
copper or lead, heated white. The attraction of
sulphur for oxygen, of copper for oxygen, and of
sulphur for copper, will probably effect the decomposition.</p>

<p>Our laboratory in the Pneumatic Institution is
nearly finished, and we shall begin the investigations
in about a fortnight. We shall begin by trying the
gases in their simplest mode of application, and
gradually carry on the more complex processes.</p>

<p>I hope the gaseous oxide of azote will prove to be
a specific stimulus for the absorbents.</p>

<p>I was last week surprised by a letter from Mr.
Watt, announcing the success of their trial. When
I was at Birmingham five weeks ago, the family
were in very low spirits. I spent nine or ten days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
there, chiefly with Mr. Keir and Mr. Watt: I had
a great deal of chemical conversation with them.
Mr. Keir is one of the best-informed men I have
ever met with, and extremely agreeable. Both he
and Mr. Watt are still phlogitians; but Mr. Keir
altogether disbelieves the doctrine of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calorique</i>.</p>

<p>What news have you in Cornwall? Has Mr.
John Hawkins returned to his native county? he
will doubtless be a great acquisition to you.</p>

<p>Pray do you know whether the Zoophyta and
marine worms are susceptible of the galvanic stimulus?
Experiments on them would go far to determine
whether the irritable or sensitive fibre is primarily
affected.</p>

<p>I know of little general scientific news. In the
last volume of the <cite>Annales de Chimie</cite> is a curious
paper by Berthollet on sulphurated hydrogen: he
makes it out to be an acid. I shall most anxiously
expect a letter from you, and I remain with affection
and respect,</p>

<p class="signature">Yours,<br />

<p>The letter which follows may be considered as a
reply to one received from Mr. Davies Gilbert,
which, it would appear, contained strictures upon
his recently published Essays.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO DAVIES GIDDY, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">April 10, 1799.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>The engagements resulting from the establishment
of the Pneumatic Institution, and from a
course of experiments, to which I have been obliged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
to pay great attention, have prevented me from
acknowledging to you my obligations for the very
great pleasure I received from your last excellent
letter.</p>

<p>In experiments on Light and Heat, we have to
deal with agents whose changes we are unable directly
to estimate. The most we can hope for is
such an arrangement of facts as will account for
most of the phenomena.</p>

<p>The supposition of active powers common to all
matter, from the different modifications of which all
the phenomena of its changes result, appears to me
more reasonable than the assumption of certain imaginary
fluids alone endowed with active powers, and
bearing the same relation to common matter, as the
vulgar philosophy supposes spirit to bear to matter.</p>

<p>That the particles of bodies must move, or separate
from each other, when they become expanded,
is certain. A repulsive motion of the particles is
directly the cause of expansion; and when bodies
are expanded by friction, under circumstances in
which there could be no heat communicated by
bodies in contact, no oxidation and no diminution
of capacity, I see no difficulty in conceiving the repulsive
motion generated by the mechanical motion.</p>

<p>Your excellent and truly philosophic observations
will induce me to pay greater attention to all my
positions. It is only by forming theories, and then
comparing them with facts, that we can hope to
discover the true system of nature. I will endeavour
very soon to give an answer to the remaining
part of your excellent letter.</p>

<p>I have now just room to give you an account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the experiments I have lately been engaged in,
though they are not much connected with light
and heat.</p>

<p><em>First.</em>&mdash;One of Mr. William Coate's children accidentally
discovered that two bonnet-canes rubbed
together produced a faint light. The novelty of
this phenomenon induced me to examine it, and I
found that the canes on collision produced sparks of
light, as brilliant as those from the flint and steel.</p>

<p><em>Secondly.</em>&mdash;On examining the epidermis, I found,
when it was taken off, that the canes no longer gave
light on collision.</p>

<p><em>Thirdly.</em>&mdash;The epidermis, subjected to chemical
analysis, had all the properties of silex.</p>

<p><em>Fourthly.</em>&mdash;The similar appearance of the epidermis
of reeds, corn, and grasses, induced me to suppose
that they likewise contained silex. By burning
them carefully, and analysing their ashes, I found
that they contained it in rather larger proportions
than the canes.</p>

<p><em>Fifthly.</em>&mdash;The corn and grasses contain sufficient
potash to form glass with their flint. A very pretty
experiment may be made on these plants with the
blow-pipe. If you take a straw of wheat, barley, or
hay,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and burn it, beginning at the top, and heating
the ashes with the blue flame, you will obtain a
perfect globule of hard glass fit for microscopic
experiments.</p>

<p>I made a discovery yesterday which proves how
necessary it is to repeat experiments. The gaseous
oxide of azote is perfectly respirable when pure. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
is never deleterious but when it contains nitrous
gas. I have found a mode of obtaining it pure, and
I breathed to-day, in the presence of Dr. Beddoes
and some others, sixteen quarts of it for near seven
minutes. It appears to support life longer than
even oxygen gas, and absolutely intoxicated me.
Pure oxygen gas produced no alteration in my
pulse, nor any other material effect; whereas this
gas raised my pulse upwards of twenty strokes,
made me dance about the laboratory as a madman,
and has kept my spirits in a glow ever since. Is not
this a proof of the truth of my theory of respiration?
for this gas contains more light in proportion to its
oxygen than any other, and I hope will prove a
most valuable medicine.</p>

<p>We have upwards of eighty out-patients in the
Pneumatic Institution, and are going on wonderfully
well.</p>

<p>I shall hope for the favour of a letter from you,
and in my answer to it will fully inform you of our
proceedings. I have just room to add that I am</p>

<p class="signature">Yours, with affection and respect,<br />
<span class="smcap j6">Humphry Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>I cannot suffer the experiments with the bonnet-canes
to pass, without endeavouring to infuse into
the reader a portion of that admiration which I feel
in relating them. They furnish a beautiful illustration
of that combination of observation, experiment,
and analogy, first recommended by Lord Bacon, and
so strictly adopted by Davy in all his future grand
researches.</p>

<p>In alluding to this discovery&mdash;that siliceous earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
exists generally in the epidermis of hollow plants&mdash;Davy
observes in his agricultural lectures, that "the
siliceous epidermis serves as a support, protects the
bark from the action of insects, and seems to perform
a part in the economy of these feeble vegetable
tribes, similar to that performed in the animal kingdom
by the shell of the crustaceous insects."</p>

<p>The circumstance that first led him to the investigation
of the nature of <em>nitrous oxide</em>, or the <em>gaseous
oxide of azote</em>, alluded to in the foregoing letter, has
been thus recorded by himself. "A short time
after I began the study of Chemistry, in March
1798, my attention was directed to the <em>dephlogisticated
nitrous gas</em> of Priestley (nitrous oxide) by Dr.
Mitchell's theory of Contagion, by which he attempted
to prove that <em>dephlogisticated nitrous gas</em>!
which he calls <em>oxide of septon</em>, was the principle of
contagion, and capable of producing the most terrible
effects, when respired by animals in the minutest
quantities, or even when applied to the skin, or
muscular fibre.</p>

<p>"The fallacy of this theory was soon demonstrated
by a few coarse experiments, made on small quantities
of this gas procured, in the first instance, from
zinc and diluted nitrous acid. Wounds were exposed
to its action; the bodies of animals were
immersed in it without injury; and I breathed it,
mingled in small quantities with common air, without
any remarkable effects. An inability to procure
it in sufficient quantities prevented me, at this time,
from pursuing the experiments to any greater extent.
I communicated an account of them to Dr.
Beddoes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
His situation in the "Medical Pneumatic Institution"
in 1799, imposing upon him the duty of
investigating the physiological effects of such aëriform
fluids as held out any promise of useful agency,
he resumed the investigation; a considerable period,
however, elapsed, before he succeeded in procuring
<em>nitrous oxide</em> in a state of purity; he was therefore
obliged to breathe it in mixture with oxygen
gas, or common air; but as no just conclusion could
be deduced from the action of an impure gas, he
commenced an enquiry for the purpose of discovering
a process by which it might be procured in an
uncontaminated condition; when, after a most laborious
investigation concerning its composition,
properties, and combinations, enquiries which were
necessarily extended to the different bodies connected
with nitrous oxide, such as <em>nitrous gas</em>,
<em>nitrous acid</em>, and <em>ammonia</em>, he was enabled, by a
series of intermediate and comparative experiments,
to reconcile apparent anomalies, and thus, by removing
the greater number of those difficulties
which had previously obscured this branch of
science, to present to the chemical world the first
satisfactory history of the <span class="smcap">Combinations of Oxygen
and Nitrogen</span>.</p>

<p>Thus prepared, he proceeded to examine the
action of nitrous oxide upon living beings, and to
compare it with the effects of other gases upon
man; and in this manner he completed its physiological,
as he had already done its chemical history.</p>

<p>These interesting results were published in a distinct
volume, in the year 1800, entitled, "Researches
Chemical and Philosophical, chiefly concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Nitrous Oxide, and its Respiration. By
Humphry Davy, Superintendent of the Medical
Institution."</p>

<p>It may be observed in passing, that the merits of
this work could never have been inferred from the
title-page, which its most sanguine admirers must
admit to be as clumsy and unpromising an invitation
as an author ever addressed to his scientific
brethren.</p>

<p>Amongst Davy's letters to Mr. Gilbert, I find
one written on a proof sheet of the chapter of contents
of the above work, and which may not be
uninteresting in this place.</p>

<p>That our feelings, as well as our actions, are
rendered stronger and more vivid by habit, is probable
from many facts, and from no one more so
than that of procrastination. My much respected
friend, two months after my return,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> I had formed
the resolution of writing to you; week after week
this resolution was renewed and put off to a future
day, with the hope that this day, by presenting
something new, would enable me to make my letter
more interesting. In vain! the feeling of procrastination,
thus increased by association, at length
became so strong as to prevent me from writing
at all.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
I have received your letter; it has awakened my
duties, and has been doubly welcome, as being unexpected
and undeserved.</p>

<p>Since my return to the Pneumatic Institution in
December, I have been almost incessantly occupied,
from January to April, in completing a series of
experiments on Gases, and their application; and
from April to the present time, in writing and
printing an account of them.</p>

<p>I have written this letter on the table of contents
of a work which will be published in the course of
the month, and of which I shall take the earliest
opportunity to send you a copy. This table of
contents will give you a better idea of the nature
and extent of the investigation, than I could possibly
have given in a letter.</p>

<p>We have been repeating the Galvanic experiments
with success. Nicholson, by means of a
hundred pieces of silver and zinc, has procured a
visible spark. Cruickshank has revived oxidated
metals in solution, by means of the nascent hydrogen
produced from the decomposition of water by
the shock; and both he and Carlisle have absolutely
resolved water into oxygen and hydrogen by
means of it, making use of silver and platina wires.
An immense field of investigation seems opened by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
this discovery: may it be pursued so as to acquaint
us with some of the laws of life!</p>

<p>You have, undoubtedly, heard of Herschel's discovery
concerning the production of heat by invisible
rays emitted from the sun. By placing one
thermometer within the red rays, separated by a
prism, and another beyond them, he found the temperature
of the outside thermometer raised more
than that of the inside one.</p>

<p>When I first heard of Mr. Tennant's discovery,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
I was very much struck by an observation which
you long ago made to me, on the fertility of the
Cornish lands, in which there was decomposed, <em>feltspar</em>
or <em>serpentine</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Tennant spent a day here some time ago,
when I mentioned your observation to him, but he
could not give any solution of the phenomenon.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quere.</i>&mdash;As lime and magnesia are probably both
subservient to vegetation, only from supplying
plants with carbonic acid, may not lime, when mingled
with magnesia, in the process of vegetation,
render it partially caustic, and thus enable it to
destroy them?</p>

<p>Your observation on the scale of numbers, and
the fact relative to it, are highly interesting. Reasoning
on this subject would literally form the logic
of generalization, or the application of one term
to signify many terms, or many ideas, on which
science ultimately depends. <i>Quere.</i>&mdash;How far have
the first attempts at generalization arisen from accident,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
and how far from the resemblance between
ideas?</p>

<p>Dr. Beddoes has always ridiculed the "<em>Tractors</em>,"
in common with all other reasonable men. He is
about to publish a new work on the Nitrous Acid.</p>

<p>J. Wedgwood is returned, very little altered for
the better. Coleridge is gone to reside in Cumberland;
he was here the week before last, and spent
much time with me, and often spoke of you with
the greatest interest. Clayfield is at this moment
chiefly engaged in commercial speculations. He
has found a new mode of making soda, which there
is every reason to believe will turn out profitable.</p>

<p>I hope some time in the autumn to see you, and
to enjoy the well remembered pleasure of your conversation;
in the mean while, I remain, with respects
to your family,</p>

</div>

<p>In estimating the early genius of Davy, and his
character as a philosopher, the style and matter of
his "<span class="smcap">Researches</span>" will afford us much assistance.
The close philosophical reasoning,&mdash;the patient and
penetrating industry,&mdash;the candid submission to
every intimation of experiment, and the accuracy of
manipulation, so remarkably displayed throughout
this work, have been rarely equalled, and perhaps
never surpassed.</p>

<p>There is scarcely to be found a more striking
illustration of chemical genius, than that afforded
by his chapter on the "Absorption of <i>Nitrous Gas
by solutions of green Sulphate of Iron</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
The address with which he gradually disentangles
the subject of its difficulties, and catches at every
opening to truth, affords a study which may be
safely recommended to the attention of every young
experimentalist, as being no less instructive than it
is beautiful.</p>

<p>The phenomena attending the absorption of <em>nitrous
gas</em> by solutions of <em>sulphate of iron</em> had been
examined by Vauquelin and by Berthollet, but the
conclusions of these chemical philosophers were fatally
infected by errors, arising from the neglected
action of the atmosphere. Davy, by conducting his
experiments over mercury, proved that, in the absence
of air, the absorption was simply owing to a
combination between the gas and the fluid; but
that, on admitting air, the nitrous <em>gas</em> became nitrous
<em>acid</em>, a portion of which, together with a part
of the water, subsequently underwent decomposition,
and gave origin to <em>ammonia</em>, and ultimately to
<em>nitrate of ammonia</em>, while the iron passed into the
state of a <em>peroxide</em>.</p>

<p>We have also to admire in this work an ardour
for investigation, which even the most imminent
personal danger could not repress. He may truly
be said to have sought the bubble reputation in the
very jaws of Death. What shall we say of that
spirit which led him to inspire nitrous gas, at the
hazard of filling his lungs with the vapour of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aqua
fortis</i>! or what, of that intrepid coolness which enabled
him to breathe a deadly gas, and to watch the
advances of its chilling power in the ebbing pulsations
at the wrist!</p>

<p>These experiments, however, are far too interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
and important to be related in any other than
the author's own words; but it is first necessary
that his trials with the <em>nitrous oxide</em> should be
considered.</p>

<p>He found that this gas might be most conveniently,
as well as most economically, prepared by
the decomposition of a salt known by the name of
<em>nitrate of ammonia</em>, by the application of a regulated
heat; but, as the researches by which he arrived at
this conclusion are recorded at length in his work,
and as the most important of them are now embodied
in every elementary system of chemistry, it
would not only be tedious but useless, to enter into
a detail of them upon this occasion.</p>

<p>"In April," he says, "I obtained nitrous oxide in
a state of purity, and ascertained many of its chemical
properties. Reflections upon these properties,
and upon former trials, made me resolve to inspire
it in its pure form, for I saw no other way in which
its respirability, or powers, could be determined.</p>

<p>"I was aware of the danger of the experiment.
It certainly would never have been made, if the
hypothesis of Dr. Mitchell had in the least influenced
my mind. I thought that the effects might,
possibly, be depressing and painful; but there were
many reasons which induced me to believe, that a
single inspiration of a gas, apparently possessing no
immediate action on the irritable fibre, could neither
destroy, nor materially injure, the powers of life.</p>

<p>"On April 11th, I made the first inspiration of
pure nitrous oxide. It passed through the bronchiæ
without stimulating the glottis, and produced no
uneasy sensations in the lungs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
"The result of this experiment proved that the
gas was respirable, and induced me to believe that a
farther trial of its effects might be made without
danger.</p>

<p>"On April 16th, Dr. Kinglake being accidentally
present, I breathed three quarts of nitrous oxide
from and into a silk bag, for more than half a minute,
without previously closing my nose, or exhausting
my lungs. The first inspirations occasioned
a slight degree of giddiness, which was succeeded
by an uncommon sense of fulness in the head, accompanied
with loss of distinct sensation and voluntary
power,&mdash;a feeling analogous to that produced
in the first stage of intoxication; but unattended by
pleasurable sensation. Dr. Kinglake, who felt my
pulse, informed me that it was rendered quicker
and fuller.</p>

<p>"This trial did not satisfy me with regard to its
powers: comparing it with the former ones, I was
unable to determine whether the operation was
stimulant or depressing.</p>

<p>"I communicated the result to Dr. Beddoes, and
on April the 17th, he was present when the following
experiment was made.</p>

<p>"Having previously closed my nostrils, and exhausted
my lungs, I breathed four quarts of the gas
from and into a silk bag. The first feelings were
similar to those produced in the last experiment;
but in less than half a minute, the respiration being
continued, they diminished gradually, and were
succeeded by a sensation analogous to gentle pressure
on all the muscles, attended by an highly pleasurable
thrilling, particularly in the chest and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
extremities. The objects around me became dazzling,
and my hearing more acute. Towards the
last inspirations, the thrilling increased, the sense of
muscular power became greater, and, at last, an
irresistible propensity to action was indulged in: I
recollect but indistinctly what followed; I know
that my motions were various and violent.</p>

<p>"These effects very soon ceased after the respiration
of the gas. In ten minutes I had recovered my
natural state of mind. The thrilling in the extremities
continued longer than the other sensations.</p>

<p>"This experiment was made in the morning; no
languor or exhaustion was consequent; my feelings
throughout the day were as usual, and I passed the
night in undisturbed repose.</p>

<p>"The next morning the recollection of the effects
of the gas was very indistinct; and had not remarks
written immediately after the experiment recalled
them to my mind, I should even have questioned
their reality."</p>

<p>Our philosopher very naturally doubted whether
some of these strong emotions might not, after all,
be attributed to the enthusiasm necessarily connected
with the perception of agreeable feelings, when he
was prepared to expect painful sensations; but he
says, that subsequent experiments convinced him
that the effects were solely owing to the specific
operation of the gas. He found that he could
breathe nine quarts of nitrous oxide for three minutes,
and twelve quarts for rather more than four;
but that he could never breathe it, in any quantity,
so long as five minutes. Whenever its operation
was carried to the highest extent, the pleasurable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
thrilling, at its height about the middle of the experiment,
gradually diminished, the sense of pressure
on the muscles was lost, impressions ceased to be
perceived, vivid ideas passed rapidly through the
mind, and voluntary power was altogether destroyed,
so that the mouthpiece generally dropped from his
unclosed lips. When he breathed from six to seven
quarts, muscular motions were produced to a great
extent: sometimes he manifested his pleasure by
stamping, or laughing only; at other times, by
dancing round the room, and vociferating.</p>

<p>During the progress of these experiments, it occurred
to him that, supposing <em>nitrous oxide</em> to be
analogous in its operation to common stimulants, the
debility occasioned by intoxication from fermented
liquors ought to be increased after excitement from
this gas, in the same manner as the debility produced
by two bottles of wine is increased by a third.
To ascertain whether this was the case, he drank a
bottle of wine, in large draughts, in less than eight
minutes. His usual drink, he tells us, was water;
he had been little accustomed to take spirits or
wine, and had never been intoxicated but once
before in the course of his life. Under such circumstances,
we may readily account for the powerful
effects produced by this quantity of wine, and
which he describes in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whilst I was drinking, I perceived a sense of
fulness in the head, and throbbing of the arteries,
not unlike that produced in the first stage of nitrous
oxide excitement: after I had finished the
bottle, this fulness increased, the objects around me
became dazzling, the power of distinct articulation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
was lost, and I was unable to stand steadily. At
this moment, the sensations were rather pleasurable
than otherwise; the sense of fulness in the
head, however, soon increased, so as to become
painful, and in less than an hour I sunk into a state
of insensibility. In this situation I must have remained
for two hours, or two hours and a half. I
was awakened by head-ache and painful nausea.
My bodily and mental debility were excessive, and
the pulse feeble and quick.</p>

<p>"In this state, I breathed for near a minute and
a half five quarts of gas, which was brought to me
by the operator for nitrous oxide; but as it produced
no sensations whatever, and apparently rather
increased my debility, I am almost convinced that
it was, from some accident, either common air, or
very impure nitrous oxide.</p>

<p>"Immediately after this trial, I respired twelve
quarts of oxygen for nearly four minutes. It produced
no alteration in my sensations at the time,
but immediately afterwards I imagined that I was
a little exhilarated.</p>

<p>"The head-ache and debility still, however, continuing
with violence, I examined some nitrous
oxide which had been prepared in the morning,
and finding it very pure, I respired seven quarts of
it for two minutes and a half. I was unconscious
of head-ache after the third inspiration; the usual
pleasurable thrilling was produced, voluntary power
was destroyed, and vivid ideas rapidly passed
through my mind; I made strides across the room,
and continued for some minutes much exhilarated;
but languor and depression, not very different in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
degree from those existing before the experiment,
succeeded; they however gradually went off before
bed-time.</p>

<p>"This experiment proved, that debility from intoxication
was not increased by excitement from
nitrous oxide. The head-ache and depression would
probably have continued longer, had it not been
administered."</p>

<p>The same work contains an account of many
other trials; but sufficient has been extracted to
show the zeal and intrepidity with which he conducted
his researches. To withhold, however, the
testimony which several other scientific persons
have given, with respect to the intoxicating influence
of this gas, would be to deprive the reader of
some very amusing descriptions.</p>

<p>First appears Mr. W. Tobin, who tells us that
he soon found his nervous system agitated by the
highest sensations of pleasure, but which were difficult
of description. When the bags were exhausted
and taken from him, he suddenly started from
his chair, and vociferating with pleasure, made towards
those that were present, as he wished they
should participate in his feelings. He struck gently
at Davy, and a stranger entering the room at
the same moment, he made towards him, and gave
him several blows, but he adds, it was more in the
spirit of good-humour, than in that of anger. He
then ran through different rooms in the house, and
at last returned to the laboratory, somewhat more
composed, although his spirits continued much elevated
for some hours after the experiment; he felt,
however, no consequent depression, either in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
evening or day following. Upon another occasion,
he states that his sensations were superior to any
thing he ever before experienced; his step was firm,
and all his muscular power increased. His nerves
were more alive to every surrounding impression;
he threw himself into several theatrical attitudes,
and traversed the laboratory with a quick step,
while his mind was elevated to a most sublime
height: he says that "it is giving but a faint idea
of his feelings to say, that they resembled those
produced by a representation of an heroic scene on
the stage, or by reading a sublime passage in poetry,
when circumstances contribute to awaken the
finest sympathies of the soul." The influence, however,
of this inspiring agent appears to have been as
transitory as its effects were vivid; for he afterwards
observes, "I have seldom lately experienced
vivid sensations. The pleasure produced by the
gas is slight and tranquil, and I rarely feel sublime
emotions, or increased muscular power."</p>

<p>The first time that Mr. Clayfield breathed the
gas, it produced feelings analogous to those of intoxication.
He was for some time unconscious of
existence, but at no period of the experiment were
his sensations agreeable; a momentary nausea followed,
but unconnected with languor or head-ache.</p>

<p>In a subsequent trial, it would appear that he
did experience certain thrillings which were highly
pleasurable.</p>

<p>The account given by Dr. Kinglake agrees pretty
much with those already cited. He adds, however,
that the inspiration of the gas had the further effect
of reviving rheumatic irritations in the shoulder and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
knee-joints, which had not been previously felt for
many months.</p>

<p>Next appears Mr. Southey, the Laureate. The
reader will no doubt be prepared to hear that the
nitrous oxide transported him, at least, to the summit
of Parnassus;&mdash;by no means: he laughed when
the bag was removed from his mouth, but it may be
fairly questioned whether this might not have been
an expression of joy at the terrors he had escaped;
for he freely confesses that he could not distinguish
between the first feelings it occasioned, and an apprehension
of which he was unable to divest himself.</p>

<p>The first time Mr. Coleridge inspired the nitrous
oxide, he felt a highly pleasurable sensation of
warmth over his whole frame: he adds, that the
only motion which he felt inclined to make, was that
of laughing at those who were looking at him: a
symptom as equivocal, perhaps, as that exhibited by
the Laureate.</p>

<p>A number of other accounts are given, but those
already related are perhaps sufficient to establish the
fact, that the gas in question possesses an intoxicating
quality, to which the enthusiasm of persons
submitting to its operation has imparted a character
of extravagance wholly inconsistent with truth.</p>

<p>It will be admitted that there must have been
something singularly ludicrous in the whole exhibition.
Imagine a party of grave philosophers, with
bags of silk tied to their mouths, stamping, roaring,
and laughing about the apartment; it is scarcely
possible to conceive a richer subject for the pencil
of a Bunbury. We cannot then be surprised at any
terms of ridicule in which a stranger, witnessing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
such an operation, might describe it. M. T. Fievée<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
appears to have considered the practice as a national
vice, and whimsically introduces it amongst the catalogue
of follies to which he considers the English
nation to be addicted.</p>

<p>Taking leave of these laughing philosophers, we
must now proceed to a much more serious branch
of the subject of Pneumatic Medicine. "Having
observed," says Davy, "that no painful effects were
produced by the application of nitrous gas to the
bare muscular fibre, I began to imagine that this
gas might also be breathed with impunity, provided
it were possible in any way to free the lungs of
common air before inspiration, so as to prevent the
formation of nitrous acid.</p>

<p>"On this supposition, during a fit of enthusiasm
produced by the respiration of nitrous oxide, I
resolved to endeavour to breathe nitrous gas: one
hundred and fourteen cubic inches of it were accordingly
introduced into the large mercurial air-holder;
two small silk bags of the capacity of seven quarts
were filled with nitrous oxide.</p>

<p>"After a forced exhaustion of my lungs, my nose
being accurately closed, I made three inspirations
and expirations of nitrous oxide in one of the bags,
in order to free my lungs, as much as possible, from
atmospheric oxygen; then, after a full expiration of
the nitrous oxide, I transferred my lips from the
mouthpiece of the bag to that of the air-holder,
and, turning the stop-cock, attempted to inspire the
nitrous gas. In passing through my mouth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
fauces, it tasted astringent and highly disagreeable;
it occasioned a sense of burning in the throat, and
produced a spasm of the epiglottis, so painful as to
oblige me to desist immediately from attempts to
inspire it. After removing my lips from the mouthpiece,
when I opened them to inspire common air,
<em>nitrous acid</em> was immediately formed in my mouth,
which burnt the tongue and palate, injured the
teeth, and produced an inflammation of the mucous
membrane, which lasted for some hours.</p>

<p>"As, after the respiration of nitrous oxide, a
small portion of the residual atmospheric air always
remained in the lungs mingled with the gas, so is it
probable that, in the experiment just related, a minute
portion of nitrous acid was formed; and, if so,
I perhaps owe the preservation of my life to the
circumstance; for, supposing that I had succeeded
in taking a full inspiration of nitrous gas, and even
that it had not produced any positive effects, it is
not likely that I should, by breathing nitrous oxide,
have so completely freed my lungs from it, as to
have prevented the formation of nitrous acid, when
I again inspired common air. I never design again
to attempt so rash an experiment."</p>

<p>His attempt to breathe carburetted hydrogen gas
was scarcely less terrific and appalling.</p>

<p>"Mr. Watt's observations on the respiration of
diluted <em>hydro-carbonate</em> by man, and the experiments
of Dr. Beddoes on the destruction of animals
by the same gas, proved that its effects were highly
deleterious.</p>

<p>"As it destroyed life, apparently by rendering
the muscular fibre inirritable, without producing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
any previous excitement, I was anxious to compare
its sensible effects with those of nitrous oxide, which
at this time I believed to destroy life by producing
the highest possible excitement.</p>

<p>"In the first experiment, I breathed for nearly
a minute three quarts of <em>hydro-carbonate</em>, mingled
with nearly two quarts of atmospheric air.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It
produced a slight giddiness, pain in the head, and a
momentary loss of voluntary power; my pulse was
rendered much quicker and more feeble. These
effects, however, went off in five minutes, and I had
no return of giddiness.</p>

<p>"Emboldened by this trial, I introduced into a
silk bag four quarts of gas nearly pure, which was
carefully produced from the decomposition of water
by charcoal an hour before, and which had a very
strong and disagreeable smell.</p>

<p>"My friend Mr. James Tobin, junior, being present,
after a forced exhaustion of my lungs, the nose
being accurately closed, I made three inspirations
and expirations of the hydro-carbonate. The first
inspiration produced a sort of numbness and loss
of feeling in the chest, and about the pectoral
muscles. After the second, I lost all power of perceiving
external things, and had no distinct sensation,
except that of a terrible oppression on the
chest. During the third expiration, this feeling
subsided, I seemed sinking into annihilation, and
had just power enough to cast off the mouthpiece
from my unclosed lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
"A short interval must have passed, during which
I respired common air, before the objects around
me were distinguishable. On recollecting myself,
I faintly articulated, '<em>I do not think I shall die.</em>'
Placing my finger on the wrist, I found my pulse
thread-like, and beating with excessive quickness.
In less than a minute, I was able to walk, and the
painful oppression on the chest directed me to the
open air.</p>

<p>"After making a few steps, which carried me to
the garden, my head became giddy, my knees trembled,
and I had just sufficient voluntary power to
throw myself on the grass. Here the painful feelings
of the chest increased with such violence as
to threaten suffocation. At this moment I asked
for some nitrous oxide. Mr. Dwyer brought me a
mixture of that gas with oxygen, and I breathed
it for a minute, and believed myself recovered.</p>

<p>"In five minutes the painful feelings began
gradually to diminish; in an hour they had nearly
disappeared, and I felt only excessive weakness, and
a slight swimming of the head. My voice was very
feeble and indistinct.</p>

<p>"I afterwards walked slowly for half an hour
with Mr. Tobin, and on my return was so much
stronger and better as to believe that the effects of
the gas had entirely passed off; though my pulse
was 120, and very feeble. I continued without
pain for nearly three quarters of an hour, when the
giddiness returned with such violence as to oblige
me to lie on the bed; it was accompanied with
nausea, loss of memory, and deficient sensation.</p>

<p>"In about an hour and a half, the giddiness went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
off, and was succeeded by an excruciating pain in
the forehead, and between the eyes, with transient
pains in the chest and extremities.</p>

<p>"Towards night these affections gradually diminished;
and at ten no disagreeable feeling, except
weakness, remained. I slept sound, and awoke
in the morning very feeble and very hungry. No
recurrence of the symptoms took place, and I had
nearly recovered my strength by the evening.</p>

<p>"I have been minute in the account of this experiment,
because it proves, that <em>hydro-carbonate</em>
acts as a sedative; that is, it produces diminution of
vital action, and consequent debility, without previously
exciting. There is every reason to believe
that, had I taken four or five inspirations, instead
of three, they would have destroyed life immediately,
without producing any painful sensation."</p>

<p>The scientific and medical world are alike indebted
to Davy for this daring experiment; and,
if the precautions it suggests be properly attended
to, it may become the means of preserving human
life. The experiment is also valuable as affording
support to physiological views, with which its author
was probably not acquainted.</p>

<p>In the first place, it may be necessary to apprize
some of my readers, that the "<em>hydro-carbonate</em>" here
spoken of, differs very little from the gas now so
generally used to illuminate our streets and houses.
We have just seen how deadly are its qualities, and
that even in a state of extreme dilution it will
affect our sensations. The question then necessarily
suggests itself, how far this gas can be safely
introduced into the interior of our apartments?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Did we not possess any direct evidence upon the
subject, the answer would be sufficiently obvious,
since it is impossible so to conduct its combustion,
that a portion shall not escape unburnt. Such is
the theory; but what is our experience upon the
subject?&mdash;that pains in the head, nausea, and distressing
languor, have been repeatedly experienced
in our theatres and saloons, by persons inhaling the
unburnt gas; that the atmosphere of a room, although
spacious and empty, will, if lighted with
gas, convey a sense of oppression to our organs of
respiration, as if we were inhaling an air contaminated
with the breath of a hundred persons.</p>

<p>In the next place, Davy's experiment is important,
inasmuch as it proves that, in cases of asphyxia,
or suspended animation, there exists a period of
danger after the respiration has been restored, and
the circulation re-established, at which death may
take place, when we are the least prepared to expect
it.</p>

<p>Bichat has shown that, when dark-coloured blood
is injected into the vessels of the brain by means
of a syringe connected with the carotid artery, the
functions of the brain become immediately disturbed,
and in a short time entirely cease: the effect is
precisely similar, whether the dark-coloured blood
be transmitted to the brain by the syringe of the
experimentalist, or by the heart itself. Thus in
cases of asphyxia, the dark-coloured blood which
has been propelled through the vessels during the
suspension or imperfect performance of respiration,
acts like a narcotic poison upon the brain; and no
sooner, therefore, does it extend its malign influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
to that organ, than deleterious effects are produced,
and the animal, after apparent recovery, falls into a
state of stupor, the pupils of the eyes become dilated,
the respiration laborious, the muscles of the
body convulsed, and it speedily dies, <em>poisoned by its
own blood</em>.</p>

<p>We are much indebted to Mr. Brodie for a series
of experiments in confirmation of these views; and
a very interesting case occurred some time since,
in the neighbourhood of Windsor, which is well
calculated for their illustration. A corporal in the
Guards, whose name, if I am not mistaken, was
Schofield, was seized with cramp as he was bathing
in the Thames, and remained for several minutes
under water. By judicious assistance, however, he
was recovered, and appeared to those about him to
be free from any danger, when he was attacked by
convulsions and expired. Had the respiration been
artificially supported at this period, so as to have
maintained the action of the heart until the black
blood had returned from the brain, the life of the
soldier might possibly have been saved.</p>

<p>In the experiment which has given origin to
these reflections, Davy distinctly states, that after
having recovered from the <em>primary</em> effects of the
carburetted hydrogen gas, and taken a walk with
his friend Mr. Tobin, he was again seized with violent
giddiness, attended with nausea and loss of
sensation. The imperfectly oxygenized or dark-coloured
blood had evidently affected the brain, and
his life, at this period, was probably in greater jeopardy
than in any other stage of the experiment.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted by the dangers to which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
preceding experiments had exposed him, Davy did
not allow more than a week to elapse before he
attempted to respire <em>fixed air</em>, or <em>carbonic acid gas</em>;
but it was in vain that he made voluntary efforts
to draw it into the windpipe; for, the moment the
epiglottis was raised a little, such a painful irritation
was induced as instantly to close it spasmodically on
the glottis; and thus, in repeated trials, was he
prevented from taking a single particle of carbonic
acid into the lungs. When, however, the gas was
diluted with a little more than double its volume of
common air, he was enabled to breathe it for nearly
a minute, when it produced a slight degree of giddiness,
and an inclination to sleep.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>It may perhaps appear extraordinary to the reader
of the "<span class="smcap">Researches</span>," that although they were
published not more than eighteen months after the
appearance of his "Essays on Heat and Light," no
allusion is made in them either to his theory or to
his new nomenclature. In relating his experiments
upon Respiration, he employs the conventional language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
of the schools, and the word "<em>phos-oxygen</em>"
does not once occur in the volume. This is fully
explained in a communication made by him to Mr.
Nicholson, and which was printed in his Journal a
short time after the publication of his Essays in the
West Country Contributions; in which he says,&mdash;"As
facts have occurred to me with regard to the
decomposition of bodies, which I had supposed to
contain light, without any luminous appearance, I
beg to be considered as a <em>sceptic</em> with respect <em>to my
own</em> particular theory of the combinations of light,
until I shall have satisfactorily explained those anomalies
by fresh experiments. On account of this
scepticism, and for other reasons, I shall in future
use the common nomenclature; excepting that, as
my discoveries concerning the gaseous oxide would
render it highly improper to call a principle, which
in one of its combinations is capable of being absorbed
by venous blood, and of increasing the
powers of life, <em>azote</em>,&mdash;I shall name it, with Dr.
Pearson, Chaptal, and others, <span class="smcap">NITROGENE</span>; and the
<em>gaseous oxide of azote</em> I shall call <span class="smcap">NITROUS OXIDE</span>."</p>

<p>The same feeling is expressed at the conclusion
of his Third Research.&mdash;"It would be easy to form
theories referring the action of blood impregnated
with <em>nitrous oxide</em>, to its power of supplying the
nervous and muscular fibre with such proportions
of condensed nitrogen, oxygen, light, or ethereal
fluid, as enabled them more rapidly to pass through
those changes which constitute their life; but we
are unacquainted with the composition of dead
organized matter; and new instruments of experiment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
and new modes of research, must be found,
before we can ascertain even our capabilities of discovering
the laws of life."</p>

<p>There is one circumstance connected with the
views entertained in this work which must not be
passed over without notice. In several passages
he advocates the theory of the atmosphere being a
<em>chemical compound</em> of oxygen and nitrogen; whereas,
in later years, he was amongst the first to insist
upon its being simply a mechanical mixture of
these gases.</p>

<p>In consequence of the highly deleterious experiments
which have been already described, and of
the constant labours of the laboratory, and the repeated
inhalation of acid and other vapours, his
health began visibly to decline, and he retired into
Cornwall, where he informs us that "the associations
of ideas and feelings, common exercise, a pure
atmosphere, luxurious diet, and a moderate indulgence
in wine, in the course of a month, restored
him to health and vigour."</p>

<p>I find an allusion to this visit in a letter from his
sister. "He had," she says, "written to his mother
of his intention to visit her, but before the post had
quitted Bristol, he was already on his way to Penzance,
and would have reached it before his letter,
had not his aunt, on whom he called in the neighbouring
town of Marazion, struck with his appearance
of ill health, insisted on his remaining there
till the next day, lest his mother should be doubly
alarmed at his unexpected visit and altered looks."
Miss Davy adds, "This one fact will serve, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
same time, to illustrate his attachment to home, and
the impetuosity of his mind, which never rested
till the object he proposed was accomplished."</p>

<p>The following letter is inserted in this place, for
the purpose of fixing the period at which he first
ascertained those new facts in Voltaic electricity,
which formed the basis of a future communication
to the Royal Society, and which may be said to
have paved the way to his grand discoveries in that
branch of science;&mdash;the dawning of that glorious
day, which we shall presently view in all its splendour
and glory.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, something extremely interesting
in receiving from himself a simple and unadorned
statement of results, as they successively presented
themselves to his observation&mdash;"Truths
plucked as they are growing, and delivered to you
before their dew is brushed off."</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO DAVIES GIDDY, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Pneumatic Institution, October 20, 1800.</p>

<p>Be assured, my respected friend, that your last
letter, though short, was highly gratifying to me.
At the moment it was brought to me, I was about
to depart with King and Danvers on an excursion
to the banks of the Wye. Our design was to see
Tintern Abbey by moonlight, and it was perfectly
accomplished.</p>

<p>After viewing for three hours all the varieties of
light and shade which a bright full moon and a
blue sky could exhibit in this beautiful ruin, and
after wandering for three days among the many-coloured
woods and rocks surrounding the river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
between Monmouth and Chepstow, we arrived on
the fourth day at Bristol, having to balance against
the pleasure of the tour, the fatigue of a stormy
voyage down the Wye, across the mouth of the
Severn, and up the Avon.</p>

<p>On analysing, after our return, specimens of the
air collected from Monmouth, from the woods on
the banks of the Wye, and from the mouth of the
Severn, there was no perceptible difference; they
were all of similar composition to the air in the
middle of Bristol; that is, they contained about
twenty-two per cent. of oxygen. The air from the
bladders of some sea-weed, apparently just cast on
shore, at the Old Passage, likewise gave the same
results; so that, comparing these experiments with
those made by Cavendish, Berthollet, &amp;c. and by
myself on other occasions, at different temperatures,
in different weather, and with different winds,
I am almost convinced that the whole of the lower
stratum of the atmosphere is of uniform composition.</p>

<p>No test can be more fallacious and imperfect
than nitrous gas, on account of the different composition
of nitrous acid, formed in the different
manipulations of eudiometrical experiments.</p>

<p>The eudiometer that I have lately employed
gives, in a few minutes, the proportions of oxygen
without correction.</p>

<p>In pursuing experiments on galvanism, during
the last two months, I have met with unexpected
and unhoped-for success. Some of the new facts
on this subject promise to afford instruments capable
of destroying the mysterious veil which Nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
has thrown over the operations and properties of
ethereal fluids.</p>

<p>Galvanism I have found, by numerous experiments,
to be a <em>process purely chemical</em>, and to depend
wholly on the oxidation of metallic surfaces, having
different degrees of electric conducting power.</p>

<p>Zinc is incapable of decomposing <em>pure</em> water; and
if the zinc plates be kept moist with <em>pure</em> water, the
galvanic pile does not act; but zinc is capable of
oxidating itself when placed in contact with water,
holding in solution either oxygen, atmospheric air,
or nitrous or muriatic acid, &amp;c.: and under such
circumstances, the galvanic phenomena are produced,
and their intensity is in proportion to the rapidity
with which the zinc is oxidated.</p>

<p>The galvanic pile only acts for a few minutes,
when introduced into hydrogen, nitrogen, or hydro-carbonate;
that is, only as long as the water between
its plates holds some oxygen in solution: immerse
it for a few moments in water containing air, and
it acts again.</p>

<p>It acts very vividly in oxygen gas, and less so in
the atmosphere. When its plates are moistened by
marine acid, its action is very powerful, but infinitely
more so when nitrous acid is employed.
Five plates with nitrous acid gave sparks equal to
those of the common pile. From twenty plates the
shock was insupportable.</p>

<p>I had almost forgotten to mention, that charcoal
is a good galvanic exciter, and decomposes water,
like the metals, in the pile; but I must stop, without
being able to expatiate on the connection which
is now obvious between galvanism and some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
phenomena of organic motion. I never consider the
subject without having forcibly impressed upon my
imagination your observations<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> on the science of
the ethereal fluids, and I cannot help flattering myself
that this age will see your predictions verified.
I remain with sincere respect and affection,</p>

<p class="signature">Yours,<br />
<span class="smcap j2">Humphry Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>That a work, of the character of the "<span class="smcap">Researches</span>,"
replete with ingenious novelty, and
rich in chemical discovery, proceeding from the pen
of so young a man, should have excited very general
admiration in the philosophic world, is a circumstance
that cannot surprise us; but in a majority of
cases, precocious merit enjoys only an ephemeral
popularity; the sensations it excites are too vivid
to be permanent, and the individual sinks into an
obscurity rendered ten times more profound by the
brilliancy of the flash which preceded it; but every
event of Davy's life would appear as if created, and
directed for his welfare, by some presiding genius,
whose activity, in throwing opportunities in his
way was rivalled only by the address with which he
converted them to his advantage. Fortune and
talent, then, were both equally engaged in accomplishing
the elevation of Davy, and it is probable
that eminent success generally requires a combination
of these elements for its production, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the maxim of Plautus is therefore as remote from
truth as that of Theophrastus, the one assigning all
to fortune, the other all to talent.</p>

<p>The experiments to which allusions have been frequently
made during the present chapter, favourably
as they were received, might have shared the fate of
many other discoveries which did not admit of an
immediate and obvious application to the purposes
of common life; for statistical value is a necessary
passport to popular favour. Fortunately, however,
for Davy, before the vivid impression produced by
his new work had lost the glow of novelty, Count
Rumford was anxiously seeking for some rising
philosopher, who might contribute his energies
towards the support, and farther increase, of the
chemical fame of the recently established "<span class="smcap">Institution
of Great Britain</span>."</p>

<p>It is not surprising that his attention should have
been readily directed to one whose genius had been
so lately displayed, and whose views regarding
Caloric<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> were in such exact conformity with his
own opinions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
As the philosophical public must feel a lively interest
in every incident connected with a transaction
so important to the interests of science, as that
by which Davy was placed in the chemical chair
of the Institution, I am fortunate in being able,
through the kindness of his two friends, Mr. Thomson
and Mr. Underwood, to present a clear and
satisfactory statement of all its circumstances and
details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="hanging">Count Rumford negotiates with Mr. Underwood on the subject of
Davy's appointment to the Royal Institution.&mdash;Terms of his
engagement communicated in a letter to Mr. Gilbert.&mdash;Davy
arrives, and takes possession of his apartments.&mdash;He receives

Purkis.&mdash;Davy's style criticised.&mdash;His extraordinary method of
experimenting.&mdash;Davy and Wollaston compared as experimentalists.&mdash;The
style of Davy as a lecturer and a writer contrasted.</p>

<p>It may be readily supposed that the prominent
situation held by Davy at Bristol, as well as the
merited celebrity of his writings, must have rendered
his name familiar to all the leading philosophers
of the day. It were vain, therefore, to enquire
through what channel the echo of his fame
first reached the ear of Count Rumford;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> it is sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
to state that Mr. Underwood, a gentleman
ardently attached to science, and devoted to the
interests of the Royal Institution, was amongst the
first to urge the expediency of inviting him to London
as a public lecturer. Mr. Underwood, in a
letter lately addressed to me from Paris, says, "In
consequence of several conversations with Count
Rumford, on the subject of Davy's superior talents,
and the advantages that would accrue to the Institution
from engaging him as a lecturer, the Count
called upon me on the 5th of January 1801, having
received from the Managers of the Institution full
powers to negotiate upon the subject. On this
occasion, however, I thought it advisable to introduce
the Count to Mr. James Thomson, as being
the more eligible person to treat in behalf of Davy,
not only on account of his greater intimacy with
him, but because, not being a proprietor, he was
unconnected with the interests of the Institution."</p>

<p>Mr. Thomson, who saw the prospect of honour
and emolument thus opened for his friend, after a
satisfactory interview with Count Rumford, immediately
wrote to Davy, with an earnest recommendation
that he should, without loss of time, come
to town, and conclude an arrangement thus auspiciously
commenced.</p>

<p>Davy, with his characteristic ardour, answered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the letter in person. He was introduced to the Managers,
and the preliminary arrangements were soon
completed; the nature of which is disclosed by himself
in the following letter to Mr. Gilbert.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="date">Hotwells, March 8, 1801.</p>

<p>I cannot think of quitting the Pneumatic Institution,
without giving you intimation of it in a
letter; indeed, I believe I should have done this
some time ago, had not the hurry of business, and
the fever of emotion produced by the prospect of
novel changes in futurity, destroyed to a certain
extent my powers of consistent action.</p>

<p>You, my dear Sir, have behaved to me with great
kindness, and the little ability I possess you have
very much contributed to develope; I should therefore
accuse myself of ingratitude, were I to neglect
to ask your approbation of the measures I have
adopted with regard to the change of my situation,
and the enlargement of my views in life.</p>

<p>In consequence of an invitation from Count Rumford,
given to me with some proposals relative to
the Royal Institution, I visited London in the middle
of February, where, after several conferences
with that gentleman, I was invited by the Managers
of the Royal Institution to become the Director of
their laboratory, and their Assistant Professor of
chemistry; at the same time I was assured that,
within the space of two or three seasons, I should
be made sole Professor of Chemistry, still continuing
Director of the laboratory.</p>

<p>The immediate emolument offered was sufficient
for my wants; and the sole and uncontrolled use of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
the apparatus of the Institution, for private experiments,
was to be granted me.</p>

<p>The behaviour of Count Rumford, Sir Joseph
Banks, Mr. Cavendish, and the other principal managers,
was liberal and polite; and they promised
me any apparatus that I might need for new experiments.</p>

<p>The time required to be devoted to the services
of the Institution was but short, being limited
chiefly to the winter and spring. The emoluments
to be attached to the office of sole Professor of Chemistry
are great; and, above all, the situation is
permanent, and held very honourable.</p>

<p>These motives, joined to the approbation of Dr.
Beddoes, who with great liberality has absolved me
from my engagements at the Pneumatic Institution,
and the strong wishes of most of my friends in
London and Bristol, determined my conduct.</p>

<p>Thus I am quickly to be transferred to London,
whilst my sphere of action is considerably enlarged,
and as much power as I could reasonably expect, or
even wish for at my time of life, secured to me
without the obligation of labouring at a profession.</p>

<p>The Royal Institution will, I hope, be of some
utility to society. It has undoubtedly the capability
of becoming a great instrument of moral and
intellectual improvement. Its funds are very great.
It has attached to it the feelings of a great number
of people of fashion and property, and consequently
may be the means of employing, to useful purposes,
money which would otherwise be squandered in
luxury, and in the production of unnecessary labour.</p>

<p>Count Rumford professes that it will be kept distinct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
from party politics; I sincerely wish that such
may be the case, though I fear it.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> As for myself,
I shall become attached to it full of hope, with the
resolution of employing all my feeble powers towards
promoting its true interests.</p>

<p>So much of my paper has been given to pure
egotism, that I have but little room left to say any
thing concerning the state of science, and the public
mind in town; unfortunately, there is little to say.
I have heard of no important discoveries. In politics,
nothing seems capable of exciting permanent
interest. The stroke of poverty, though severely
felt, has been a torpedo, benumbing all energy, and
not irritating and awakening it, as might have been
expected.</p>

<p>Here, at the Pneumatic Institution, the nitrous
oxide has evidently been of use. Dr. Beddoes is
proceeding in the execution of his great popular
physiological work, which, if it equals the plan he
holds out, ought to supersede every work of the
kind.</p>

<p>I have been pursuing Galvanism with labour, and
some success. I have been able to produce galvanic
power from simple plates, by effecting on
them different oxidating and deoxidating processes;
but on this point I cannot enlarge in the small remaining
space of paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Your remark concerning <em>negative</em> Galvanism, and
deoxidation, is curious, and will most probably hold
good.</p>

<p>It will give me much pleasure to see your mathematical
Paper<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> in the Philosophical Transactions,
but it will be, unfortunately, to me the pleasure
of <em>blind</em> sympathy, though derived from the
consciousness that you ought to be acting upon,
and instructing the world at large.</p>

<p>It will give me sincere pleasure to hear from you,
when you are at leisure. After the 11th I shall be
in town&mdash;my direction, Royal Institution, Albemarle
Street. I am, my dear friend, with respect
and affection,</p>

<p class="signature">Yours,<br />
<span class="j2 smcap">Humphry Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The first notice of Davy's name, in the Minute
Book of the Royal Institution, occurs in the Report
adopted at a Meeting of the Managers, on Monday
the 16th of February 1801.</p>

<p>"Resolved&mdash;That Mr. Humphry Davy be engaged
in the service of the Royal Institution, in
the capacities of Assistant Lecturer in Chemistry,
Director of the Laboratory, and Assistant Editor
of the Journals of the Institution, and that he be
allowed to occupy a room in the house, and be furnished
with coals and candles; and that he be paid
a salary of one hundred guineas per annum."</p>

<p>On the 16th of March 1801, after reporting that
"a room had been prepared and furnished for
Davy," the Minute proceeds to state that "Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Davy had arrived at the Institution on Wednesday
the 11th of March, and taken possession of his situation."</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, that the first impression produced
on Count Rumford by Davy's personal appearance,
was highly unfavourable to the young
philosopher, and he expressed to Mr. Underwood
his great regret at having been influenced by the
ardour with which his suit had been urged; and
he actually would not allow him to lecture in the
Theatre, until he had given a specimen of his abilities
in the smaller lecture-room. His first lecture,
however, entirely removed every prejudice which
had been formed; and at its conclusion the Count
emphatically exclaimed&mdash;"Let him command any
arrangements which the Institution can afford." He
was accordingly, on the very next day, promoted
to the great Theatre.</p>

<p>Davy's uncouth appearance and address subjected
him to many other mortifications on his first arrival
in London. There was a smirk on his countenance,
and a pertness in his manner, which, although arising
from the perfect simplicity of his mind, were
considered as indicating an unbecoming confidence.
Johnson, the publisher, as many of my readers will
probably remember, was in the custom of giving
weekly dinners to the more distinguished authors
and literary stars of the day. Davy, soon after
his appointment, was invited upon one of these
occasions, but the host actually considered it necessary
to explain, by way of apology, to his company,
the motives which had induced him to introduce
into their society a person of such humble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
pretensions. At this dinner a circumstance occurred,
which must have been very mortifying to the
young philosopher. Fuseli was present, and, as
usual, highly energetic upon various passages of
beauty in the poets, when Davy most unfortunately
observed, that there were passages in Milton
which he could never understand. "Very likely,
very likely, Sir," replied the artist in his broad German
accent, "but I am sure that is not Milton's fault."</p>

<p>On the 7th of April, he was elected a member
of a society which consisted of twenty-five of the
most violent republicans of the day; it was called
the "<i>Tepidarian</i> Society," from the circumstance of
nothing but tea being allowed at their meetings,
which were held at Old Slaughter's Coffee House
in Saint Martin's Lane. To the influence of this
society, Mr. Underwood states that Davy was greatly
indebted for his early popularity. Fame gathers
her laurels with a slow hand, and the most brilliant
talents require a certain time for producing a due
impression upon the public; the <i>Tepidarians</i> exerted
all their personal influence to obtain an audience
before the reputation of the lecturer could
have been sufficiently known to attract one.</p>

<p>Although the acquaintance between Davy and
Count Rumford commenced so inauspiciously, they
very soon became friends, and mutually entertained
for each other the highest regard.</p>

<p>Davy's improved manners and naturally simple
habits, at this period, were highly interesting and
exemplary: towards his old friends he conducted
himself with the greatest amenity, and frequently
consulted them upon certain points connected with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
his new station in society. The following anecdote
was communicated by Mr. Underwood.&mdash;"I introduced
him," says he, "to my old friend, the excellent
Sir Henry Englefield, who was the first intimate
acquaintance Davy had formed in the higher circles;
he was received by him with all that warmth of
manner, and kindness of feeling, which so eminently
distinguished him. Shortly after this introduction,
Sir Harry sent him an invitation to
meet me at dinner. Davy found himself unable
to frame an answer to his satisfaction, and fearing
he might betray his ignorance of etiquette, ran to
my house, and greatly alarmed my mother by the
extreme anxiety he displayed, and the manner in
which he entreated her to send me to him the moment
I returned. I went and found him cudgelling
his brains to produce this first attempt at fashionable
composition; a dozen answers were on
his table, and he was in the highest degree excited
and annoyed."</p>

<p>It would appear that, immediately after his arrival
at the Royal Institution, he entered upon the duties
of his station, and performed them so greatly to the
satisfaction of the Managers, that, at a Meeting held
on the first of June, not more than six weeks afterwards,
the following Resolutions were passed.</p>

<p>"Resolved&mdash;That Mr. Humphry Davy, Director
of the Chemical Laboratory, and Assistant Lecturer
in Chemistry, has, since he has been employed at
the Institution, given satisfactory proofs of his
talents as a Lecturer.</p>

<p>"Resolved&mdash;That he be appointed, and in future
denominated, Lecturer in Chemistry at the Royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Institution, instead of continuing to occupy the
place of <em>Assistant</em> Lecturer, which he has hitherto
filled."</p>

<p>From an examination of the Minute Book, it
appears that Dr. Garnett, whose health had long
been on the decline, resigned his professorship on
the 15th of June,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and that on the 6th of July in
the same year, Dr. Young was engaged as Professor
of Natural Philosophy, Editor of the Journals, and
general Superintendent of the House, at the salary
of 300<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>With Dr. Garnett he had lived on terms of great
intimacy; with his successor he associated with less
ease and freedom.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Managers, also held in July,
several Resolutions were passed to the following
effect.</p>

<p>"Resolved&mdash;That a Course of Lectures on the
Chemical Principles of the Art of Tanning be given
by Mr. Davy. To commence the second of November
next; and that respectable persons of the trade,
who shall be recommended by Proprietors of the
Institution, be admitted to these lectures gratis.</p>

<p>"Resolved further&mdash;That Mr. Davy have permission
to absent himself during the months of
July, August, and September, for the purpose of
making himself more particularly acquainted with
the practical part of the business of tanning, in
order to prepare himself for giving the above-mentioned
course of lectures."</p>

<p>Davy, it would appear, availed himself of the
permission granted to him by the above resolution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
of the Managers, and during the interval visited his
native country.</p>

<p>He had arranged with his friend Underwood to
make a tour through Cornwall; but as it was his
wish to remain at Bristol for a few days, on his way
to the West, it was agreed between them that they
should meet at Penzance.</p>

<p>Davy, however, became impatient, and wrote
the following letter to his friend, a composition of
much wildness, and obnoxious to the suspicion of
Spinosism.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="opening">MY DEAR UNDERWOOD,</p>

<p>That part of Almighty God which resides in the
rocks and woods, in the blue and tranquil sea, in the
clouds and sunbeams of the sky, is calling upon thee
with a loud voice: religiously obey its commands,
and come and worship with me on the ancient altars
of Cornwall.</p>

<p>I shall leave Bristol on Thursday next, possibly
before, so that by this day week I shall probably be
at Penzance. Ten days or a fortnight after, I shall
expect to see you, and to rejoice with you.</p>

<p>We will admire together the wonders of God,&mdash;rocks
and the sea, dead hills and living hills covered
with verdure. Amen.</p>

<p>Write to me immediately, and say when you
will come. Direct H. Davy, Penzance. Farewell,
Being of energy!</p>

<p class="signature">Your's with unfeigned affection,<br />
<span class="smcap j6">H. Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Underwood transmitted to me the above
letter with the following extract from his journal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
"On the 25th I went to Bristol, and on the 30th
arrived at Mrs. Davy's at Penzance. On the 1st of
August we set off on a pedestrian excursion, and
proceeded along the edge of the cliffs, round the
Land's End, Cape Cornwall, Saint Just, and Saint
Ives, to Redruth, and thence back to Penzance.</p>

<p>"Two days afterwards we again started, and
trudged along the shore to the Lizard. Kynance
Cove had from the commencement of our intimacy
been a daily theme of his conversation. No epithets
were sufficiently forcible to express his admiration
at the beauty of the spot: the enthusiastic delight
with which he dwelt upon the description of the
Serpentine rocks, polished by the waves, and reflecting
the brightest tints from their surfaces, seemed
inexhaustible, and when we had arrived at the spot
he appeared absolutely entranced.</p>

<p>"During these excursions his conversation was
most romantic and poetical. His views of Nature,
and her sublime operations, were expressed without
reserve, as they rapidly presented themselves to his
imagination: they were the ravings of genius; but
even his nonsense was that of a superior being."</p>

<p>At the village of Mullion, a little incident occurred,
which evinced the existence of that gastronomic
propensity which, in after years, displayed itself
in a wider range of operations. The tourists had,
on their road, purchased a fine large bass of a fisherman,
with the intention of desiring the landlady to
dress it. On arriving at the inn, Mr. Underwood
retired into a room for the purpose of making some
notes in the journal he regularly kept. Davy had
disappeared. In the course of a few minutes a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
tremendous uproar was heard in the kitchen, and
the indignant vociferations of the hostess, which,
even with all the advantages of Cornish recitative,
was not of the most melodious description, became
fearfully audible. Davy, it seems, had volunteered
his assistance in making the sauce and stuffing for
the aforesaid bass; and had he not speedily retreated,
his services would have been rewarded, not
according to the scientific practice of appending a
string of letters to his name, but in conformity
with the equally ancient custom of attaching a
certain dishonourable addition to the skirts of his
jacket.</p>

<p>I have observed that his letter to Mr. Underwood
betrayed a tincture of <em>Spinosism</em>. It may be here
remarked, that during the year 1801 he composed
a poem, which he arbitrarily distinguished by that
appellation, singularly opposed to the tenor of the
sentiments. Through the kindness of Mr. Greenough
I possess a copy of it in its original state, for
it was subsequently altered, and published in a collection,
edited by Miss Johanna Baillie; and still
more recently, it underwent farther corrections, and
was printed for private circulation in the form in
which I shall here introduce it.</p>

The following letter was written from London,
after his return from his Cornish excursion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO DAVIES GIDDY, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Royal Institution, Nov. 14, 1801.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>After leaving Cornwall in August, I spent
about three weeks in Bristol, and at Stowey, so
that I did not arrive in London until the 20th of
September.</p>

<p>On my arrival I found that Count Rumford had
altered his plans of absence, and had left London
on that very day for the Continent, purposing to
return in about two months. He is now at Paris,
and in about a fortnight we expect him here.</p>

<p>I shall soon have an opportunity of submitting
Captain Trevitheck's boiler to his observation,
and in my next letter I shall give you his opinion
of it.</p>

<p>You of course have read an account of Dr. Herschel's
experiments on the heat-making rays; from
some late observations it appears, that there are
other invisible rays beyond the violet ones, possessed
of the <em>chemical</em> agency of Light. Sennebier
ascertained some time ago that the violet
rays blackened muriate of silver in three seconds;
whereas the red rays required, for this effect, twenty
minutes. Ritter and Dr. Wollaston have found
that beyond the violet rays there is exerted a strong
deoxidating action. Muriate of silver placed in the
spectrum is not altered beyond the red rays; but it
is instantly blackened when placed on the outside
of the violet rays. I purpose to try whether the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
invisible deoxidating rays will produce light, when
absorbed by solar phosphorus.</p>

<p>The most curious galvanic facts lately noticed,
are the combustion of gold, silver, and platina. Professor
Tromsdorf, by connecting the ends of a
moderately strong battery with gold and silver leaf,
produced the combustion of them with vivid light.
In repeating the experiment on a thin slip of
platina, I have produced the same effect.</p>

<p>I yesterday ascertained rather an important fact,
namely, that a galvanic battery may be constructed
<em>without any metallic substance</em>! By means of ten
pieces of well-burnt charcoal, nitrous acid, and
water, arranged alternately in wine-glasses, I produced
all the effects usually obtained from zinc,
silver, and water.</p>

<p>The Bakerian Lecture by Dr. Young, our Lecturer
on Natural Philosophy, is now reading before
the Royal Society. He attempts to revive the
doctrine of Huygens and Euler, that light depends
upon undulations of an ethereal medium. His
proofs (i.e. his presumptive proofs) are drawn from
some strong and curious analogies he has discovered
between Light and Sound.</p>

<p>I shall strongly hope, now the Peace has arrived,
to see you soon in London, as you proposed a tour
through the Continent; indeed, you should fix
your permanent residence in London, where alone
you can do what you ought&mdash;instruct and delight
numbers of improved men.</p>

<p class="signature2">I am, my friend, yours<br />
<span class="j1">With unfeigned esteem and respect,</span><br />
<span class="smcap j6">Humphry Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Although during 1801 Davy had given some
desultory Lectures, his splendid career cannot be
said to have commenced until the following year,
when on the 21st of January he delivered his Introductory
Lecture to a crowded and enlightened
audience in the Theatre of the Royal Institution;
which was afterwards printed at the request of a
respectable proportion of the Society.</p>

<p>It contains a masterly view of the benefits to be
derived from the various branches of science. He
represents the Chemist as the Ruler of all the
elements that surround us, and which he employs
either for the satisfaction of his wants, or the gratification
of his wishes. Not contented with what is
to be found on the surface of the earth, he describes
him as penetrating into her bosom, and even of
searching the depths of the ocean, for the purpose
of allaying the restlessness of his desires, or of extending
and increasing the boundaries of his power.</p>

<p>In examining the science of Chemistry, with
regard to its great agency in the improvement of
society, he offers the following almost prophetic
remarks. "Unless any great physical changes
should take place upon the globe, the permanency
of the Arts and Sciences is rendered certain, in consequence
of the diffusion of knowledge, by means
of the invention of Printing; and by which those
words which are the immutable instruments of
thought, are become the constant and widely diffused
nourishment of the mind, and the preservers
of its health and energy.</p>

<p>"Individuals influenced by interested motives or
false views, may check for a time the progress of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
knowledge;&mdash;moral causes may produce a momentary
slumber of the public spirit;&mdash;the adoption of
wild and dangerous theories, by ambitious or deluded
men, may throw a temporary opprobrium on
literature; but the influence of true philosophy will
never be despised; the germs of improvement are
sown in minds, even where they are not perceived;
and sooner or later, the spring-time of their growth
must arrive.</p>

<p>"In reasoning concerning the future hopes of the
human species, we may look forward with confidence
to a state of society, in which the different orders
and classes of men will contribute more effectually
to the support of each other than they have hitherto
done. This state, indeed, seems to be approaching
fast; for, in consequence of the multiplication of the
means of instruction, the man of science and the
manufacturer are daily becoming more assimilated
to each other. The artist, who formerly affected to
despise scientific principles, because he was incapable
of perceiving the advantages of them, is now so far
enlightened as to favour the adoption of new processes
in his art, whenever they are evidently connected
with a diminution of labour; and the increase
of projectors, even to too great an extent, demonstrates
the enthusiasm of the public mind in its
search after improvement.</p>

<p>"The arts and sciences, also, are in a high degree
cultivated and patronized by the rich and privileged
orders. The guardians of civilization and of refinement,
the most powerful and respected part of
society, are daily growing more attentive to the
realities of life,&mdash;and giving up many of their unnecessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
enjoyments, in consequence of the desire to
be useful, are becoming the friends and protectors of
the labouring part of the community.</p>

<p>"The unequal division of property and of labour,
the differences of rank and condition amongst mankind,
are the sources of power in civilized life&mdash;its
moving causes, and even its very soul. In considering
and hoping that the human species is capable of
becoming more enlightened and more happy, we can
only expect that the different parts of the great
whole of society should be intimately united together,
by means of knowledge and the useful
arts; that they should act as the children of one
great parent, with one determinate end, so that
no power may be rendered useless&mdash;no exertions
thrown away.</p>

<p>"In this view, we do not look to distant ages,
or amuse ourselves with brilliant though delusive
dreams, concerning the infinite improveability of
man, the annihilation of labour, disease, and even
death, but we reason by analogy from simple facts,
we consider only a state of human progression arising
out of its present condition,&mdash;we look for a time
that we may reasonably expect&mdash;<span class="smcap">FOR A BRIGHT
DAY, OF WHICH WE ALREADY BEHOLD THE DAWN</span>."</p>

<p>The extraordinary sensation produced amongst
the members of the Institution by this first course
of lectures, has been vividly described by various
persons who had the good fortune to be his auditors;
and foreigners have recorded in their travels
the enthusiasm with which the great English chemist
had inspired his countrymen.</p>

<p>The members of the Tepidarian Society, sanguine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
in the success of their child,&mdash;for so they considered
Davy,&mdash;purposely appointed their anniversary festival
on the day of his anticipated triumph. They
were not disappointed in their hopes; and their
dinner was marked by every demonstration of hilarity.
In the evening, Davy accompanied by a few
friends, attended, for the first time in his life, a masquerade
which was given at Ranelagh.</p>

<p>On the following day, he dined with Sir Harry
Englefield. I have a copy of the invitation, addressed
to Mr. Underwood, now before me.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="opening">DEAR UNDERWOOD,</p>

<p>Davy, covered with glory, dines with me to-day
at five. If you could meet him, it would give me
great pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="j2">Tilney Street, Friday.</span><span class="left10">Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap left40">H. C. Englefield</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>At this dinner, Sir Harry wrote a request to Davy
to print his Lecture, which was signed by every one
present, except Mr. Underwood, who declined, from
the apprehension that the signature of so intimate a
friend might give to that which was a spontaneous
homage to talent, the appearance of a previously
concerted scheme.</p>

<p>I shall here weave into my narrative some extracts
from several letters, with which Mr. Purkis,
one of the earliest friends of Davy, has lately favoured
me.</p>

<p>"On his first appointment at the Royal Institution,
I was specially introduced to him by a common
friend, Thomas Poole, Esq. of Nether Stowey
in Somersetshire; and I continued in habits of friendship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
with him during a great portion of his life,
though somewhat less intimately during the last
few years. I loved him living&mdash;I lament his early
death: I shall ever honour his memory.</p>

<p>"The sensation created by his first course of Lectures
at the Institution, and the enthusiastic admiration
which they obtained, is at this period scarcely
to be imagined. Men of the first rank and talent,&mdash;the
literary and the scientific, the practical and
the theoretical, blue-stockings, and women of fashion,
the old and the young, all crowded&mdash;eagerly
crowded the lecture-room. His youth, his simplicity,
his natural eloquence, his chemical knowledge,
his happy illustrations and well-conducted experiments,
excited universal attention and unbounded
applause. Compliments, invitations, and presents,
were showered upon him in abundance from all
quarters; his society was courted by all, and all
appeared proud of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>"One instance of attention is particularly recalled
to my memory. A talented lady, since well
known in the literary world, addressed him anonymously
in a poem of considerable length, replete
with delicate panegyric and genuine feeling. It
displayed much originality, learning, and taste: the
language was elegant, the versification harmonious,
the sentiments just, and the imagery highly poetical.
It was accompanied with a handsome ornamental
appendage for the watch, which he was
requested to wear when he delivered his next lecture,
as a token of having received the poem, and
pardoned the freedom of the writer. It was long
before the fair authoress was known to him, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
they afterwards became well acquainted with each
other."</p>

<p>I should not redeem the pledge given to my
readers, nor fulfill the duties of an impartial biographer,
were I to omit acknowledging that the
manners and habits of Davy very shortly underwent
a considerable change. Let those who have
vainly sought to disparage his excellence, enjoy the
triumph of knowing that he was not perfect; but
it may be asked in candour, where is the man of
twenty-two years of age, unless the temperature of
his blood were below zero, and his temperament as
dull and passionless as the fabled god of the Brahmins,
who could remain uninfluenced by such an
elevation? Look at Davy in the laboratory at
Bristol, pursuing with eager industry various abstract
points of research; mixing only with a few
philosophers, sanguine like himself in the investigation
of chemical phenomena, but whose sphere
of observation must have been confined to themselves,
and whose worldly knowledge could scarcely
have extended beyond the precincts of the Institution
in which they were engaged. Shift the
scene&mdash;behold him in the Theatre of the Royal
Institution, surrounded by an aristocracy of intellect
as well as of rank; by the flowers of genius,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of fashion, and the beauty of England,
whose very respirations were suspended in eager
expectation to catch his novel and satisfactory elucidations
of the mysteries of Nature. Could the
author of the Rambler have revisited us, he would
certainly have rescinded the passage in which he
says&mdash;"All appearance of science is hateful to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
women; and he who desires to be well received by
them, must qualify himself by a total rejection of
all that is rational and important; must consider
learning as perpetually interdicted, and devote all
his attention to trifle, and all his eloquence to compliment."</p>

<p>It is admitted that his vanity was excited, and his
ambition raised, by such extraordinary demonstrations
of devotion; that the bloom of his simplicity
was dulled by the breath of adulation; and that,
losing much of the native frankness which constituted
the great charm of his character, he unfortunately
assumed the garb and airs of a man of
fashion; let us not wonder if, under such circumstances,
the inappropriate robe should not always
have fallen in graceful draperies.</p>

<p>At length, so popular did he become, under the
auspices of the Duchess of Gordon and other leaders
of high fashion, that even their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</i> were considered
incomplete without his presence; and yet
these fascinations, strong as they must have been,
never tempted him from his allegiance to Science:
never did the charms of the saloon allure him from
the pursuits of the laboratory, or distract him from
the duties of the lecture-room. The crowds that
repaired to the Institution in the morning were, day
after day, gratified by newly devised and highly
illustrative experiments, conducted with the utmost
address, and explained in language at once perspicuous
and eloquent.</p>

<p>He brought down Science from those heights
which were before accessible only to a few, and
placed her within the reach of all; he divested the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
goddess of all severity of aspect, and represented
her as attired by the Graces.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not possible to convey a better idea
of the fascination of his style, than by the relation
of the following anecdote. A person having observed
the constancy with which Mr. Coleridge
attended these lectures, was induced to ask the poet
what attractions he could find in a study so unconnected
with his known pursuits. "I attend
Davy's lectures," he replied, "to increase my stock
of metaphors."</p>

<p>But, as Johnson says, in the most general applause
some discordant voices will always be heard;
and so was it upon the present occasion. It was
urged by several modern <i>Zoili</i>, that the style was
far too florid and imaginative for communicating
the plain lessons of truth; that he described objects
of Natural History by inappropriate imagery, and
that violent conceits frequently usurped the place
of philosophical definitions. This was B&oelig;otian criticism;
the Attic spirits selected other points of
attack: they rallied him on the ground of affectation,
and whimsically represented him as swayed by
a mawkish sensibility, which constantly betrayed
him into absurdity. There might be some show of
justice in this accusation: The world was not large
enough to satisfy the vulgar ambition of the conqueror,
but the minutest production of nature
afforded ample range for the scrutinizing intelligence
of the philosopher; and he would consider a
particle of crystal with so delicate a regard for its
minute beauties, and expatiate with so tender a tone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
of interest on its fair proportions, as almost to convey
an idea that he bewailed the condition of necessity
which for ever allotted it so slender a place in
the vast scheme of creation.</p>

<p>After the observations which have been offered
with regard to the injurious tendency of metaphors
in all matters relating to science, I may probably be
charged with inconsistency in defending Davy from
the attacks thus levelled against his style. We
need not the critic to remind us that the statue of a
Lysippus may be spoiled by gilding; but I would
observe that the style which cannot be tolerated in
a philosophical essay, may under peculiar circumstances
be not only admissible, but even expedient,
in a popular lecture. "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neque ideo minus efficaces
sunt orationes nostræ quia ad aures judicantium cum
voluptate perveniunt. Quid enim si infirmiora horum
temporum templa credas, quia non rudi cæmento, et
informibus tegulis exstruuntur; sed marmore nitent
et auro radiantur?</i>"</p>

<p>Let us consider, for a moment, the class of persons
to whom Davy addressed himself. Were they
students prepared to toil with systematic precision,
in order to obtain knowledge as a matter of necessity?&mdash;No&mdash;they
were composed of the gay and
the idle, who could only be tempted to admit
instruction by the prospect of receiving pleasure,&mdash;they
were children, who could only be induced to
swallow the salutary draught by the honey around
the rim of the cup.</p>

<p>It has been well observed, that necessity alone
can urge the traveller over barren heaths and snow-topped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
mountains, while he treads with rapture
along the fertile vales of those happier climes where
every breeze is perfume, and every scene a picture.</p>

<p>If Science can be promoted by increasing the
number of its votaries, and by enlisting into its
service those whom wealth and power may render
valuable as examples or patrons, there does not
exist a class of philosophers to which we are more
largely indebted than to popular lecturers, or to
those whose eloquence has clothed with interest,
subjects otherwise severe and uninviting. How
many disciples did Mineralogy acquire through the
lectures of Dr. Clarke at Cambridge, who may
truly be said to have covered a desert with verdure,
and to have raised from barren rocks flowers of
every hue and fragrance! In the sister university,
what an accession of strength and spirit have the
animated discourses of Dr. Buckland brought to the
ranks of Geologists! To judge fairly of the influence
of a popular style, we should acquaint ourselves
with the effects of an opposite method; and
if an appeal be made to experience, I may very
safely abide the issue. Dr. Young, whose profound
knowledge of the subjects he taught, no one
will venture to question, lectured in the same theatre,
and to an audience similarly constituted to that
which was attracted by Davy, but he found the
number of his attendants diminish daily, and for
no other reason than that he adopted too severe and
didactic a style.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
In speaking of Davy's lectures as mere specimens
of happy oratory, we do injustice to the philosopher.
Had he merely added the Corinthian foliage
to a temple built by other hands, we might have commended
his taste, and admired his talent of adaptation,
and there our eulogium must have ended; but
the edifice itself was his own; he dug the materials
from the quarry, formed them into a regular pile,
and then with his masterly touch added to its strength
beauty, and to its utility grace.</p>

<p>In addition to these morning lectures, we find
that he was also engaged in delivering a course in
the evening; of which the following notice is extracted
from one of the scientific journals of the time.
"On the 25th, Mr. Davy commenced a course of
lectures on Galvanic phenomena. Sir Joseph Banks,
Count Rumford, and other distinguished philosophers,
were present. The audience were highly gratified,
and testified their satisfaction by general and
repeated applause.</p>

<p>"Mr. Davy, who appears to be very young, acquitted
himself admirably. From the sparkling intelligence
of his eye, his animated manner, and the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>, we have no doubt of his attaining a
very distinguished eminence."</p>

<p>From a Minute entered on the Records of the
Institution, it appears that, at a meeting of Managers
held on the 31st of May 1802, it was moved by
Sir Joseph Banks, and seconded by Mr. Sullivan,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That Mr. Humphry Davy be for the future
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
styled <em>Professor of Chemistry</em> to the Royal Institution."</p>

<p>A sufficient proof of the universal feeling of admiration
which his lectures had excited.</p>

<p>The success of his exertions is communicated by
him to his early friend, in the following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO DAVIES GIDDY, ESQ.</p>

<p class="opening">DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>Since the commencement of the Session at the
Institution, I have had but few moments of leisure.
The composition of a first course of lectures, and
the preparation for experiments, have fully occupied
my time; and the anxieties and hopes connected
with a new occupation have prevented me
from paying sufficient attention even to the common
duties and affections of life. Under such circumstances,
I trust you will pardon me for having
suffered your letters to remain so long unanswered.
In human affairs, anticipation often constitutes happiness:
your correspondence is to me a real source
of pleasure, and, believe me, I would suffer no opportunity
to escape of making it more frequent and
regular.</p>

<p>My labours in the Theatre of the Royal Institution
have been more successful than I could have
hoped from the nature of them. In lectures, the
effect produced upon the mind is generally transitory;
for the most part, they amuse rather than
instruct, and stimulate to enquiry rather than give
information. My audience has often amounted to
four and five hundred, and upwards; and amongst
them some promise to become permanently attached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
to Chemistry. This science is much the fashion
of the day.</p>

<p>Amongst the latest scientific novelties, the two
new planets occupy the attention of Astronomers,
while Natural Philosophers and Chemists are still
employed upon Galvanism.</p>

<p>In a paper lately read before the Royal Society,
Dr. Herschel examines the magnitudes of the bodies
discovered by Mr. Piazzi and Dr. Olbers. He supposes
the apparent diameter of Ceres to be about
22´´, and that of Pallas, 17´´ or 13´´, so that their real
diameters are 163, and 95 or 71 English miles&mdash;How
small! The Doctor thinks that they differ
from planets in their general character, as to their
diminutive size, the great inclination of their orbits,
the coma surrounding them, and as to the proximity
of their orbits.&mdash;From comets, in their want of their
eccentricity, and any considerable nebulosity. He
proposes to call them <em>Asteroids</em>.</p>

<p>I mentioned to you in a former letter the great
powers of Galvanism in effecting the combustion
of metals. I have lately had constructed for the
laboratory of the Institution, a battery of immense
size: it consists of four hundred plates of five inches
in diameter, and forty, of a foot in diameter. By
means of it, I have been enabled to inflame cotton,
sulphur, resin, oil, and ether; it fuses platina wire,
and makes red hot and burns several inches of iron
wire of 1-300th of an inch in diameter; it easily
causes fluid substances, such as oil and water, to
boil, decompounds them, and converts them into
gases. I am now examining the agencies of it upon
certain substances that have not as yet been decomposed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
and in my next letter I hope to be able to
give you an account of my experiments.</p>

<p>I shall hope soon to hear that the roads of England
are the haunts of Captain Trevitheck's dragons.
You have given them a characteristic name.</p>

<p>I wish any thing would happen to tempt you to
visit London. You would find a number of persons
very glad to see you, with whose attentions you
could not be displeased. With unfeigned respect,</p>

<p class="signature">Yours sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap j4">H. Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>It is perhaps not possible to imagine a greater
contrast, than between the elegant manner in which
Davy conducted his experiments in the theatre, and
the apparently careless and slovenly style of his
manipulations in the laboratory: but in the one
case he was communicating knowledge; in the other,
obtaining it. Mr. Purkis relates an anecdote very
characteristic of this want of refinement in his working
habits. "On one occasion, while reading over
to me an introductory lecture, and wishing to expunge
a needless epithet, instead of taking up the
pen, he dipped his forefinger into the ink-bottle,
and thus blotted out the unmeaning expletive."</p>

<p>It was his habit in the laboratory, to carry on
several unconnected experiments at the same time,
and he would pass from one to the other without
any obvious design or order: upon these occasions
he was perfectly reckless of his apparatus; breaking
and destroying a part, in order to meet some want
of the moment. So rapid were all his movements,
that, while a spectator imagined he was merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
making preparations for an experiment, he was actually
obtaining the results, which were just as accurate
as if a much longer time had been expended.
With Davy, rapidity was power.</p>

<p>The rapid performance of intellectual operations
was a talent which displayed itself at every period
of his life. We have heard with what extraordinary
rapidity he read at the age of five years; and
we now learn that his chemical enquiries were conducted
with similar facility and quickness.</p>

<p>His early friend Mr. Poole bears his testimony to
the existence of the same quality in the following
passage, extracted from a letter I had lately the
favour of receiving from him. "From my earliest
knowledge of my admirable friend, I consider his
most striking characteristic to have been the quickness
and truth of his apprehension. It was a power
of reasoning so rapid, when applied to any subject,
that he could hardly be himself conscious of the
process; and it must, I think, have been felt by
him, as it appeared to me, pure intuition. I used
to say to him, 'You understand me before I half
understand myself?'</p>

<p>"I recollect on our first acquaintance, he knew
but little of the practice of agriculture. I was at
that time a considerable farmer, and very fond of
the occupation. During his visits in those days, I
was at first something like his teacher, but my pupil
soon became my master both in theory and practice."</p>

<p>The chemical manipulations of Wollaston and
Davy offered a singular contrast to each other, and
might be considered as highly characteristic of the
temperaments and intellectual qualities of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
remarkable men. Every process of the former was
regulated with the most scrupulous regard to microscopic
accuracy, and performed with the utmost
neatness of detail. It has been already stated with
what turbulence and apparent confusion the experiments
of the latter were conducted; and yet each
was equally excellent in his own style; and, as
artists, they have not unaptly been compared to
Teniers and Michael Angelo. By long discipline,
Wollaston had acquired such power in commanding
and fixing his attention upon minute objects, that
he was able to recognise resemblances, and to distinguish
differences, between precipitates produced by
re-agents, which were invisible to ordinary observers,
and which enabled him to submit to analysis the
minutest particle of matter with success. Davy,
on the other hand, obtained his results by an intellectual
process, which may be said to have consisted
in the extreme rapidity with which he seized
upon, and applied, appropriate means at appropriate
moments.</p>

<p>Many anecdotes might be related in illustration
of the curiously different structure of the minds of
these two ornaments of British Science. The reader
will, in the course of these memoirs, be furnished
with sufficient evidence of the existence of
those qualities which I have assigned to Davy;
another biographer will no doubt ably illustrate
those of Dr. Wollaston.</p>

<p>I shall only observe, that to this faculty of minute
observation, which Dr. Wollaston applied with
so much advantage, the chemical world is indebted
for the introduction of more simple methods of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
experimenting,&mdash;for the substitution of a few glass
tubes, and plates of glass, for capacious retorts and
receivers, and for the art of making grains give the
results which previously required pounds. A foreign
philosopher once called upon Dr. Wollaston
with letters of introduction, and expressed an
anxious desire to see his laboratory. "Certainly,"
he replied; and immediately produced a small tray
containing some glass tubes, a blow-pipe, two or
three watch-glasses, a slip of platinum, and a few
test bottles.</p>

<p>Wollaston appeared to take great delight in showing
by what small means he could produce great
results. Shortly after he had inspected the grand
galvanic battery constructed by Mr. Children, and
had witnessed some of those brilliant phenomena
of combustion which its powers produced, he accidentally
met a brother chemist in the street, and
seizing his button, (his constant habit when speaking
on any subject of interest,) he led him into
a secluded corner; when taking from his waistcoat
pocket a tailor's thimble, which contained a galvanic
arrangement, and pouring into it the contents
of a small phial, he instantly heated a platinum wire
to a white heat.</p>

<p>There was another peculiarity connected with
Wollaston's habit of minute observation: it enabled
him to press into his service, at the moment, such
ordinary and familiar materials as would never have
occurred to less observing chemists. Mr. Brande
relates an anecdote admirably calculated to exemplify
this habit. He had called upon Dr. Wollaston
to consult him upon the subject of a calculus;&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
will be remembered that neither phosphate of
lime, constituting the '<em>bone earth</em>' species, nor the
ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate, commonly called
the '<em>triple phosphate</em>,' is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">$1</i>fusible; but that
when mixed, these constitute the '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fusible calculus</i>'
which readily melts before the blow-pipe. Dr.
Wollaston, on finding the substance under examination
refractory, took up his paper-folder, and
scraping off a fragment of the ivory, placed it on
the specimen, when it instantly fused.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Having contrasted the manipulations of Davy,
as exhibited in the theatre, with those performed
by him in the laboratory, it may, in this place,
be interesting to offer a few remarks upon the difference
of his style as a lecturer and as a writer.
Whatever diversity of opinion may have been entertained
as to the former, I believe there never
was but one sentiment with respect to the latter.
There is an ethereal clearness of style, a simplicity
of language, and, above all, a freedom from
technical expression, which render his philosophical
memoirs fit studies and models for all future
chemists. Mr. Brande, in a late lecture delivered
before the members of the Royal Institution, very
justly alluded to this latter quality of his writings,
and forcibly contrasted it with the system of Berzelius,
of whom it is painful to speak but in terms
of the most profound respect, and yet it is impossible
not to express a deep regret at this distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
chemist's introduction of a system of technical
expressions, which from its obscurity is calculated
to multiply rather than to correct error, and from
its complications, to require more labour than the
science to which it administers: to apply the quaint
metaphor of Locke, "it is no more suited to improve
the understanding, than the move of a jack
is to fill our bellies."</p>

<p>From the readiness with which some continental
chemists have adopted such terms, and from the
spirit in which they have defended them, one might
almost be led to suspect that they believed them,
like the words used by the Magi of Persia, to
possess a cabalistic power. Davy foresaw the injury
which science must sustain from such a practice,
and endeavoured, both by precept and example,
to discountenance it.</p>

<p>With regard to the introduction of a figurative
and ornamental style into memoirs purely scientific,
no one could entertain a more decided objection;
and in his "Last Days," he warns us against the
practice.</p>

<p>"In detailing the results of experiments, and in
giving them to the world, the chemical philosopher
should adopt the simplest style and manner; he will
avoid all ornaments, as something injurious to his
subject, and should bear in mind the saying of the
first king of Great Britain, respecting a sermon
which was excellent in doctrine, but overcharged
with poetical allusions and figurative language,&mdash;"that
the tropes and metaphors of the speaker were
like the brilliant wild flowers in a field of corn, very
pretty, but which did very much hurt the corn."</p>

<p>After the fatigues and anxieties of his first
session, Davy sought relaxation and repose amidst
the magnificent scenery of Wales. The following
letter will serve more fully to exhibit the enthusiasm
he experienced in contemplating Nature in
her wild and simplest forms.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO SAMUEL PURKIS, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Matlock, August 15, 1802.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>Had I been alone, and perfectly independent as
to my plans, I should probably have written to you
long ago. I should have begged you to hasten
your departure, so that we might have rejoiced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
together in Wales, under the influence of that
moon which is now full in all its glory; for Derbyshire,
taken as a whole, has not pleased me. A few
beautiful valleys, placed at the distance of many
miles from each other, do not compensate for the
almost uniform wildness and brown barrenness of
the hills and plains; and in the watering places, there
is little amongst the <em>living beings</em> to awaken deep
moral feelings, or to call the nobler powers of the
mind, which act in consequence of sympathy, into
existence.</p>

<p>I have longed for the mountain scenery, and for
the free inhabitants of North Wales; and even the
majestic valleys of the Wye and the Derwent have
been to me but typical of something more perfect
in beauty and grandeur.</p>

<p>Whenever it shall seem fitting to you, I shall be
prepared for our long contemplated journey, and do
not delay your departure;&mdash;<em>before</em> the 21st would
be more agreeable to me than <em>after</em> that period; and
then we shall be able to view the horns of the next
moon, where they are most beautiful.</p>

<p>I have enquired much concerning Dove-dale,
since I have been here, and, from the most accurate
accounts, I am inclined to believe that it is inferior,
in point of sublime scenery, to <em>Chee Tor</em>, near Bakewell,
and in beauty, to the valley of the <em>Great Tor</em>,
in which I am now writing. On the whole, I think
your best plan will be to meet me at Matlock,
which you must see, and then, in our route to Buxton,
we can visit the valley of the Wye, and the
most noble <em>Chee Tor</em>.</p>

<p>Concerning the excursion of Dove-dale, I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
undecided, and it shall depend upon you to determine
with regard to it.</p>

<p>As one great object in our excursions is to view
Nature and man in their most simple forms, and to
gain a temporary life of new impressions, I submit
to you whether it will not be best to steer clear of
<em>towns</em>, <em>cities</em>, and <em>civilized society</em>, in which, for the
most part, we can see what we have only seen
before.</p>

<p>If we visit Sir Joseph Banks, it certainly should
be only <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</i>: and to see that most excellent
personage, and to be obliged to quit him immediately,
will be at least painful; for the respectful
feelings he produces in the mind are always modified
by affection.</p>

<p>I have no room to give you the quantity of
information that I have gained concerning the
places and people of Wales; this shall serve for our
Derbyshire chat. I thank you much for your last
kind letter, which gave me high pleasure. You
possess the true spirit of composition, which embodies
facts in words.</p>

<p class="signature">I am, &amp;c.<br />
<span class="smcap j2">H. Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>I am informed by Mr. Purkis, that in the latter
end of this summer, he made a pedestrian tour with
Davy, through North and South Wales, and he has
transmitted to me the following account of this
excursion.&mdash;"We visited every place possessing any
remains of antiquity, any curious productions of
nature or art, and every spot distinguished by romantic
and picturesque scenery. Our friend's diversified
talents, with his knowledge of Geology, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Natural History in general, rendered him a most
delightful companion in a tour of this description.
Every mountain we beheld, and every river we
crossed, afforded a fruitful theme for his scientific
remarks. The form and position of the mountain,
with the several <em>strata</em> of which it was composed,
always procured for me information as to its character
and classification; and every bridge we crossed
invariably occasioned a temporary halt, with some
appropriate observations on the productions of the
river, and on the diversion of angling.</p>

<p>"In one of our morning excursions in North
Wales, we ascended the summit of <i>Arran Benllyn</i>,
a celebrated mountain, inferior only to Snowdon and
Cader Idris, a few miles from the lake of Bala.
Here we were fortunate in beholding a scene of
extraordinary sublimity, seldom witnessed in this
climate. From the top of this mountain we looked
down, about mid-day, on a deep valley eight or ten
miles in length, and as many in breadth, the whole
of which, for a considerable height from the surface
of the ground, was filled with beautiful clouds,
while the atmosphere around the summit on which
we stood was perfectly clear, and the sky above us
of a deep blue colour. The clouds in the valley
were in irregular, gentle undulations, dense, compact,
and continuous, of that kind which is denominated
by Meteorologists <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cirro-cumulus</i>, and by the
vulgar, <em>woolpack</em> clouds, such as are often seen in
the higher regions on a fine summer's day. The
sun shone with great brilliancy, and illumined their
various forms with silver, grey and blue tints of
exquisite beauty. As there was scarcely a breath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
of air stirring below the mountain, this aggregation
of clouds, probably occasioned by some electrical
agency, remained fixed and stationary, as if identified
with the valley. The higher parts of most of
the surrounding hills were enveloped in mist, above
which the tops of <em>Snowdon</em> and <em>Cader Idris</em> towered
distinctly visible, and appeared like small islands
rising out of the sea. This scene altogether was one
of inexpressible magnificence and grandeur, filling
the mind with awe and rapture. We seemed to
feel ourselves like beings of a higher order in a
celestial region, looking down on the lower world
with conscious superiority.</p>

<p>"After sitting and ruminating on this sublime
spectacle for two or three hours, we left the summit
of the mountain with reluctance, and, slowly descending,
rested at intervals, and often cast a longing,
lingering look behind.</p>

<p>"On reaching our comfortable inn at Bala, while
waiting for dinner, Davy walked about the room,
and, as if by inspiration, broke out in a beautiful
impassioned apostrophe on the striking scene we
had so recently witnessed. It was in a kind of unmeasured
blank verse, highly animated and descriptive,
at once poetical and philosophical. At the
conclusion of this eloquent effusion, I endeavoured
to recollect and commit it to writing, but I could
not succeed, and Davy was too modest to assist my
memory.</p>

<p>"In a tour through North Wales, where the few
small inns have seldom any spare rooms, different
parties are often obliged to sit in the same apartment,
and to eat at the same table. Hence we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
were occasionally introduced to characters of various
descriptions, some of whom gratified us by their
agreeable qualities, while others disgusted us by
their ignorance and impertinence. On one occasion,
after a heavy shower of rain in the middle of
August, we were drying our clothes by the fire in
the little Inn at <em>Tan y Bwlch</em>, when the landlord
requested us to admit a gentleman, who was very
wet. A young man, of pleasing appearance and
manner, was then introduced, and after some common-place
observations, we sat down to dinner.
The stranger was evidently a man of education
and acquirements, and after the cloth had been
removed, he began to discourse very fluently on
scientific subjects. He talked of oxygen and
hydrogen, of hornblende, and the <em>Grawacké</em> of
Werner, and geologists, in the most familiar tone
of self-complacency.</p>

<p>"Davy's youth, simplicity of manner, and cautious
concealment of superior knowledge, not exciting
constraint, our companion was naturally induced
to deliver his opinions with the utmost freedom
and confidence on all subjects. We commenced on
poetry and painting; the sublime and beautiful;
then proceeded to mineralogy, astronomy, &amp;c. and
occasionally digressed on topics of mirth and humour,
so that the evening was passed with general
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"When Davy had retired to rest, and I was left
alone with our companion, I enquired how he liked
my friend, and whether he considered him a proficient
in science, and versed in chemistry and geology?
He answered coolly, that 'he appeared to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
rather a clever young man, with some general scientific
knowledge.' He then asked his name, and
when I announced 'Davy, of the Royal Institution,'
the stranger seemed thunderstruck, and exclaimed,
'Good God! was that really Davy? How have I
exposed my ignorance and presumption!' It is
scarcely necessary to add, that at the breakfast
table the next morning, he talked on subjects of
science with less volubility than on the preceding
evening."</p>

<p>After Davy's return from this expedition, he
wrote the following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO DAVIES GIDDY, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">      Royal Institution, Oct. 26, 1802.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>It is long since I have had the pleasure of hearing
from you. You probably received a hasty letter
that I wrote to you in the beginning of the summer.
Since that period, I have been idling away
much of my time in Derbyshire and North Wales.</p>

<p>Till very lately, I had hopes of being able to
spend a few weeks of the autumn in Cornwall, but
I now find that it will not suit with my occupations.
Not having it in my power to see you, you
may believe that I am most anxious to hear from
you.</p>

<p>We hear, at this time, in London of comparatively
few scientific novelties. The wonders of revolutionized
Paris occupy many of our scientific men;
and the summer and autumn are not the working
seasons in great cities. The rich and fashionable
part of the community think it their duty to kill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
time in the country, and even philosophers are more
or less influenced by the spirit of the times.</p>

<p>In the last volume of the Manchester Memoirs,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> the fifth, are some papers of Mr. Dalton on the
Constitution of the Atmosphere; on the expansive
powers of Steam; and on the dilatation of Elastic
Fluids by Heat. As far as I can understand his
subjects, the author appears to me to have executed
them in a very masterly way. I wish very much
to have your judgment upon his opinions, some of
which are new and very singular.</p>

<p>Have you yet seen the theory of my colleague,
Dr. Young, on the undulations of an Ethereal Medium
as the cause of Light? It is not likely to be
a popular hypothesis, after what has been said by
Newton concerning it. He would be very much
flattered if you could offer any observations upon
it, whether for or against it. The paper is in the
last volume of the Transactions.</p>

<p>I believe I mentioned to you in a former letter
that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terra Japonica</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Extractum Catechu</i>, contained
a very large proportion of the tanning principle.
My friend Mr. Purkis, an excellent practical
tanner, has lately tried some experiments upon
it in the large way. It answers very well, and I
am now wearing a pair of shoes, the leather of one
of which was tanned with oak-bark, and that of the
other with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terra Japonica</i>; and they appear to be
equally good. We are in great hopes that the East
India Company will consent to the importation of
this article. One pound of it goes at least as far as
nine pounds of oak-bark; and it could certainly be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
rendered in England for less than four-pence the
pound: oak-bark is nearly one penny per pound.</p>

<p>The <em>Zoonic acid</em>, which M. Berthollet supposed
to be a peculiar acid, has been lately shown by M.
Thénard to be only acetous acid, holding a peculiar
animal matter in solution.</p>

<p>Gregory Watt is just returned from the Continent,
where he has passed the last fifteen months.
He has been much delighted with his excursion,
but his health is at present bad. I trust, however,
that English roast-beef and English customs will
speedily restore it.</p>

<p>We are publishing, at the Royal Institution, a
Journal of Science, which contains chiefly abridged
accounts of what is going on in different parts of
Europe, with some original papers; and in hopes
that its diffusion may become more general, we
have fixed its price at one shilling. As soon as
I have an opportunity, I will send you the last
numbers of it.</p>

<p>I am beginning to think of my Course of Lectures
for the winter. In addition to the common
course of the Institution, I have to deliver a few
lectures on Vegetable Substances, and on the connection
of Chemistry with Vegetable Physiology,
before the Board of Agriculture. I have begun
some experiments on the powers of soils to absorb
moisture, as connected with their fertility. I have,
for this purpose, made a small collection of those of
the <em>calcareous</em> and <em>secondary</em> countries, and I wish
very much for some specimens from the <em>granitic</em>
and <em>schistose</em> hills of Cornwall. If you could, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
much trouble, cause to be procured from your
estates different pieces of uncultivated soil, of about
a pound weight each, I should feel much obliged to
you. They should be accompanied by specimens of
the stone or strata on which they lie.</p>

<p>I am, dear Sir, with affection and respect, yours,</p>

<p class="signature smcap">H. Davy.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the Journals alluded to in the above letter, it
would seem that Davy and Dr. Young were the
joint editors. The former appears both as a reviewer
and an original writer, and in each capacity
we recognise the peculiarities of his genius: in the
one case, by the quickness with which he detects
error; and in the other, by the avidity with which
he apprehends truth.</p>

<p>It will not be uninteresting to take a short review
of his original communications, especially as the
work has become extremely scarce; indeed, as it
was published in numbers, it is very probable that
only a few copies have escaped the common fate of
periodicals.</p>

<p>His first paper is entitled, "An Account of a
New Eudiometer," and has for its principal object
the recommendation of the solution of the green
muriate, or sulphate of iron, impregnated with
<em>nitrous</em> gas; the knowledge of the properties of
which, in absorbing oxygen gas, arose out of those
experiments to which an allusion has been already
made.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>This test is prepared by transmitting a current of
nitrous gas through a saturated solution of the salt

of iron. As the absorption of the gas proceeds, the
solution acquires the colour of a deep olive brown;
and when the impregnation is completed, it appears
opaque and almost black. The process is apparently
owing to a simple elective attraction; in no
case is the gas decomposed; and under the exhausted
receiver it resumes its elastic form, leaving the
fluid with which it was combined, unaltered in its
properties. The test, therefore, can only be regarded
as a convenient modification of that of Priestley,
in which the nitrous gas was presented to the atmospheric
air to be examined, without the intervention
of any third body.</p>

<p>The only apparatus required for the application
of the test, as suggested by Davy, is a small graduated
tube, having its capacity divided into one
hundred parts, and a vessel for containing the fluid.
The tube, after being filled with the air to be examined,
is introduced into the solution, and shaken
in contact with it; when the air will be rapidly
diminished in volume, and the whole of its oxygen,
in a few minutes, condensed into nitrous acid.</p>

<p>By means of this test, Davy informs us that he
examined the atmosphere in different places, without
being able to ascertain any notable difference in
the proportions of its component parts.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight years have elapsed since the publication
of this paper; and yet, amidst the rapid progress
of discovery, Eudiometry has not been able
even to modify the results it has given us; but the
reader will be pleased to remember, that by these
tests it is only professed to show the relative proportions
of oxygen in air; the salubrity of an atmosphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
depends upon many other causes, especially
its condition with regard to moisture, which,
in a variety of ways, exerts an influence upon the
structures of the body.</p>

<p>In this Journal we also find several original communications
from Davy on galvanic phenomena,
which will be noticed on a future occasion. There
is likewise a paper of considerable interest, entitled,
"An Account of a method of copying Paintings
upon Glass, and of making Profiles, by the agency
of Light upon Nitrate of Silver, invented by T.
Wedgwood, Esq.: with Observations by H. Davy."</p>

<p>In the first place, he gives an account of the
experiments of Mr. Wedgwood, and then, with
his usual sagacity, extends our knowledge of the
subject by his own researches.</p>

<p>Chemists had been long acquainted with the fact,
that white paper, or white leather, moistened with a
solution of the <em>nitrate of silver</em>, although it does not
undergo any change when kept in a dark place, will
speedily change colour on being exposed to daylight;
and that, after passing through different
shades of grey and brown, it will at length become
nearly black. These alterations in colour take place
more speedily in proportion as the light is more intense.
In the direct beams of the sun, two or three
minutes are sufficient,&mdash;in the shade, several hours
are required, to produce the full effect; and light
transmitted through differently coloured glass, acts
upon it with different degrees of intensity. It is
found, for instance, that red rays, or the common
sunbeams passed through red glass, have very little
action upon it; yellow and green are more efficacious;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
but blue and violet produce the most decided
and powerful effects. Davy observes that these facts
were analogous to those which were long ago observed
by Scheele, and confirmed by Senebier.</p>

<p>To Mr. Wedgwood, however, belongs the merit
of having first applied them for the ingenious purpose
of copying engravings, &amp;c. His first attempt
was to copy the images formed by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">camera obscura</i>;
but they were found to be too faint to produce,
in any moderate time, the necessary changes
upon the <em>nitrate of silver</em>. With paintings on glass
he was more successful; for the copying of which,
the solution should be applied on leather, which is
more readily acted upon than paper. When a surface
thus prepared is placed behind a painting on
glass, exposed to the solar light, the rays transmitted
through the differently coloured surfaces produce
distinct tints of brown or black, sensibly differing
in intensity, according to the shades of the
picture; and where the light is unaltered, the colour
of the <em>nitrate</em> becomes deepest.</p>

<p>Besides this application of the method of copying,
there are many others. It may be rendered subservient
for making delineations of all such objects as
are possessed of a texture partly opaque, and partly
transparent; such, for instance, as the woody fibres
of leaves, and the wings of insects; for which purpose,
it is only necessary to cause the direct solar
light to pass through them, and to receive the shadows
upon prepared leather.</p>

<p>To Davy we are indebted for an extremely beautiful
application of this principle,&mdash;that of copying
small objects produced by means of the solar microscope.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
For the success, however, of this experiment,
it is necessary that the prepared leather should
be placed at a small distance only from the lens.</p>

<p>The copy of a painting, or the profile of an
object, thus obtained, must of course be preserved
in an obscure place; for all the attempts that have
been made to prevent the uncoloured parts of the
copy from being acted upon by light, have hitherto
been unsuccessful. They have been covered with
a thin coating of fine varnish; and they have been
submitted to frequent washings; yet, even after
this latter operation, it would seem that a sufficient
quantity of the active matter will still adhere to
the white parts of the surface, and cause them to
become dark on exposure to the rays of the sun.
From this circumstance, Davy thinks it probable
that a portion of the metallic oxide abandons its
acid, to enter into union with the animal or vegetable
substance, so as to form with it an insoluble
compound.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Davy had made some
early experiments on the collision of flint and steel
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</i>:<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> we find in the Royal Institution Journal
a farther investigation of the subject; when he
admits that, although sparks are not produced under
these circumstances, yet that a faint light becomes
visible. In many instances, he refers the phenomenon
to electricity excited by friction, more especially
in the instances of glass, quartz, sugar, &amp;c. which
give out light when rubbed. In other cases, he
considers it probable that a species of phosphorescence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
may be occasioned by the heat; and he thinks
that there may occasionally take place an actual ignition
of abraded particles, in consequence of their
imperfect conducting power: a supposition which
he thinks receives strong support from an experiment
of Mr. Wedgwood, who found that a piece
of window-glass, when brought into contact with a
revolving wheel of grit, became red hot at its point
of friction, and gave off luminous particles that
were capable of inflaming gunpowder and hydrogen
gas.</p>

<p>We shall also find in this volume an account of
some observations which he made upon the motions
of small pieces of <em>acetate of potash</em>, during their solution,
upon the surface of water. After the interesting
and extraordinary observations of Mr.
Brown, every phenomenon of this kind is calculated
to excite attention.</p>

<p>Davy states that the fragments were agitated by
very singular motions during the time of their solution,
sometimes revolving for a second or two, and
then moving rapidly backwards and forwards in
various directions. He considers the phenomenon
as evidently connected with the rapid process of
solution, since the motions became weaker as the
point of saturation approached. The thinnest film
of oil, or of ether, wholly destroyed the effect.
Those pieces which were most irregular in their
forms underwent, by far, the most rapid motions;
from which, he thinks, it would appear, that the
phenomenon was in some measure owing to changes
in the centre of gravity of the particles during their
solution. The projectile motions, however, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
seem to depend upon the continual descent of a
current of the saline solution from the agitated particle,
in consequence of which, the surrounding
water would press upon different parts of it with
different degrees of force. Besides which, an increase
of temperature, which was found to accompany
the solution of the salt, might in a degree
modify the effect.</p>

<p>His first communication to the Royal Society was
entitled "An Account of some Galvanic Combinations,
formed by an arrangement of single metallic
plates and fluids, analogous to the Galvanic Apparatus
of M. Volta."</p>

<p>It was read on the 18th of June 1801, and will
be examined in a future part of these memoirs.</p>

<p>The certificate, recommending him as a candidate
for the honour of a seat in the Royal Society, was
read for the first time on the 21st of April 1803;
and having been duly suspended in the meeting-room,
during ten sittings of the Society, according
to the statute, he was put to the ballot, and elected
on the 17th of November in the same year.</p>

<p>As every circumstance connected with the progress
of Davy will be hereafter viewed with considerable
interest, I shall here introduce the form of
the certificate, and record the names of those Fellows
who sanctioned it by their signatures.</p>

<p>On the 7th of July, in the same year, he was
elected an Honorary Member of the Dublin Society,
having been proposed from the chair by the Vice-President,
General Vallancey.</p>

<p>It has been stated that, shortly after Davy's arrival
at the Institution, the Managers, being anxious
to encourage all investigations of a practical tendency,
directed him to deliver a series of lectures on
the art of tanning. With this view, he entered
into a scientific examination of the subject, in which
he was encouraged by Sir Joseph Banks, the liberal
patron and promoter of all useful knowledge, who
supplied him with various materials for experiment.</p>

<p>The subject had recently attracted considerable
attention, both at home and abroad, but much still
remained to be effected; and Davy succeeded in
adding many important facts to the general store.</p>

<p>In the Royal Institution Journal already noticed,
we find several communications from him, under
the titles of "Observations on different methods of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
obtaining Gallic Acid;"&mdash;"On the processes of Tanning,"
&amp;c. All the new facts however, discovered in
the course of his experiments, were embodied in a
long and elaborate memoir, which was read before
the Royal Society on the 24th of February 1803,
and published in the Philosophical Transactions for
that year. It was entitled "An Account of some
Experiments and Observations on the constituent
parts of certain astringent Vegetables, and on their
operation in Tanning. By Humphry Davy, Professor
of Chemistry in the Royal Institution. Communicated
by the Right Honourable Sir Joseph
Banks, P. R. S."</p>

<p>Although Seguin and Proust had already examined
many of the properties of that vegetable principle
to which the name of <em>tannin</em> had been given,
yet its affinities had been but little examined; and
the manner in which its action upon animal matters
may be modified by combination with other substances,
had been still less considered.</p>

<p>His principal design in this enquiry was to elucidate
the practical part of the art of tanning skins,
so as to form leather; but in pursuing this object,
he was necessarily led into chemical investigations
connected with the analysis of the various bodies
containing the tanning principle, and the peculiar
properties and value of each.</p>

<p>The vegetable principles that had been regarded
as more usually present in astringent infusions, are
<em>tannin</em>, <em>gallic acid</em>, and <em>extractive matter</em>. In attempting
to ascertain the relative proportions of
<em>tannin</em> contained in different infusions, Davy was
led, after various trials, to prefer the generally received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
method of precipitating by means of <em>gelatine</em>
procured from isinglass. In using this test, however,
he discovered that several precautions were
necessary;&mdash;that the solution should be quite fresh,&mdash;that
it should be as much saturated as may be
compatible with its fluidity,&mdash;and that the precipitate
obtained should be reduced to a uniform degree
of dryness.</p>

<p>It is evident that if the quantity of gelatine in
the solution, employed as the precipitant, be known,
it will only be necessary to ascertain the weight of
the precipitate produced by it, in order to learn
the absolute proportion of tannin present in any
specimen.</p>

<p>He next directed his attention to the discovery
of some method by which the <em>gallic acid</em> might be
separated from <em>extractive matter</em>, in cases where they
exist in combination, but the enquiry was not successful;
for, as he observes, it is difficult to render
the <em>extractive</em> insoluble, so as to separate it, without
at the same time decomposing the gallic acid. It is
true that æther will dissolve the latter, without
exerting much action upon the former; but then,
he adds, whenever the gallic acid is in large quantities,
this method will fail, "in consequence of that
<em>affinity</em> which is connected with mass." Here then
he adopts that celebrated theory of Berthollet,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
which he afterwards so vigorously and successfully
attacked.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
As general tests of the respective quantities of
these two principles (gallic acid and extractive
matter), he employed the solutions of the salts of
alumina and those of the peroxidated salts of iron.
The former of these precipitates <em>extractive</em>, without
materially acting upon <em>gallic acid</em>, which is thrown
down by the latter: the greatest care, however,
must be taken not to add the iron in excess, as in
that case the black precipitate formed will be redissolved,
and an olive-coloured and clear fluid be
only obtained.</p>

<p>He details the results of a number of experiments
made upon galls, and ascertains the relative proportions
of their several elements; and he proves that
tannin may exist in such a state of combination in
different substances as to elude the test of gelatine;
in which case, to detect its presence, it is necessary
to have recourse to the action of the diluted acids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Sir Joseph Banks had concluded, from the sensible
properties of <em>catechu</em>,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra Japonica</i>, that it
was rich in tannin: Davy confirmed this opinion
by experiment. The leather tanned by it appeared
to possess the same qualities as when tanned in the
usual manner; and although this substance contains
a small portion of extractive matter, yet the increase
of weight of the skin was rather less than when
solutions of galls were used.</p>

<p>In examining different barks, he was not able to
procure from them any free gallic acid, but their infusions
gave, on evaporation, tannin and extractive.
The greater number of his experiments were made
on the barks of the oak, the Leicester willow, the
Spanish chestnut, the elm, and the common willow.
The largest quantity of tannin he found to be contained
in the interior, or white cortical layers; and
the largest quantity of extractive matter in the exterior
layers; the epidermis, or rough outward bark,
did not contain either the one or the other.</p>

<p>From his general observations he is inclined to
suppose that, in all the astringent vegetables, the
tannin is of the same species, and that all the differences
attributed to it depend upon its state of
combination with other principles.</p>

<p>In applying the results of his experiments to the
theory of tanning, he considers the process as simply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
depending upon the union of the tannin with the
matter of the skin, in such a manner as to form
with it an insoluble compound. Gallic acid, he feels
assured, does not produce any notable effects in the
process; but he thinks that the quality of the leather
depends, in some degree, upon the quantity of
extractive matter it may imbibe.</p>

<p>Skin, combined with extractive matter only, would
be increased in weight, become coloured, and be
extremely flexible, but it would not be insoluble
in water; and were it combined with tannin alone,
it would be heavier and less supple than when both
these principles enter into the compound.</p>

<p>He examines with great acuteness and precision
some of the more popular opinions entertained by
tanners, and brings his science to bear very satisfactorily
upon several of their processes.</p>

<p>The grand secret, on which the profit of the trade
mainly depends, is to give the hides the greatest
increase of weight in the least possible time. To
effect this, various schemes have been proposed,
many of which, from the ignorance of the operators,
instead of promoting, have defeated the object.
Different <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">menstrua</i> have been suggested for expediting
the process, and amongst them lime-water
and the solutions of pearl-ash; but, as he has clearly
shown, these two substances form compounds with
tannin which are not decomposable by gelatine;
whence it follows that their effects must be pernicious;
and there is very little reason to suppose that
any bodies will be found which, at the same time
that they increase the solubility of tannin in water,
will not likewise diminish its attraction for skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
His experiments having proved that the saturated
infusions of astringent barks contain much less
extractive matter, in proportion to their tannin,
than those which are weaker, it follows, that by
quickly tanning the skin, we render the leather less
durable. These observations show that there is
some foundation for the vulgar opinion of workmen,
concerning what is technically called the <em>feeding</em>
of leather in the slow method of tanning.</p>

<p>Such is an outline of this interesting paper, in
which the author has displayed the talent so characteristic
of his mind&mdash;that of bringing science and
art into useful alliance with each other. It forms, at
this day, the guide of the tanner; and those who
previously carried on the process by a routine of operations,
of which they knew not the reasons, are now
capable of modifying it, without the risk of spoiling
the result. Many of those expedients which have
been brought forward as novelties in later years, may
be found in this paper; or, at least, have arisen out
of the principles disclosed during his investigations.</p>

<p>It has been stated that, shortly after Davy's successful
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i> as a lecturer, his manners underwent a
change, and that, to the regret of his friends, he lost
much of his native simplicity. On the 5th of February
1802, he had dined with Sir Harry Englefield
at his house at Blackheath; and eighteen years
afterwards, the worthy Baronet alluded to his interesting
demeanour upon that occasion, in terms sufficiently
expressive of his feelings&mdash;"It was the last
flash of expiring Nature." It was natural that his
best friends, on perceiving this change of manner,
should entertain some apprehensions as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
deeper qualities of his heart. Mr. Purkis has placed
in my hands the following letter addressed to him
by Mr. Coleridge; it will interest the reader by the
force and truth with which its talented writer characterises
the perils which beset the elevated path of
the young philosopher at the commencement of his
career.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO SAMUEL PURKIS, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Nether Stowey, Feb. 17, 1803.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR PURKIS,</p>

<p>I received your parcel last night, by post, from
Gunville, whither (crossly enough) I am going with
our friend Poole to-morrow morning. I do from
my very heart thank you for your prompt and
friendly exertion, and for your truly interesting letter.
I shall write to Wedgwood by this post; he
is still at Cote, near Bristol; but I shall take the
<cite>Bang</cite> back with me to Gunville, as Wedgwood
will assuredly be there in the course of ten days.
Jos. Wedgwood is named the Sheriff of the County.
When I have heard from Wedgwood, or when he
has tried this <cite>Nepenthe</cite>, I will write to you. I have
been here nearly a fortnight; and in better health
than usual. Tranquillity, warm rooms, and a dear
old friend, are specifics for my complaints. Poole
is indeed a very, very good man. I like even his
incorrigibility in small faults and deficiencies: it
looks like a wise determination of Nature to let
well alone; and is a consequence, a necessary one
perhaps, of his immutability in his important good
qualities. His journal, with his own comments,
has proved not only entertaining but highly instructive
to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
I rejoice in Davy's progress. There are three
Suns recorded in Scripture:&mdash;Joshua's, that stood
still; Hezekiah's, that went backward; and David's,
that went forth and hastened on his course, like a
bridegroom from his chamber. May our friend's
prove the latter! It is a melancholy thing to see a
man, like the Sun in the close of the Lapland summer,
meridional in his horizon; or like wheat in a
rainy season, that shoots up well in the stalk, but
does not <cite>kern</cite>. As I have hoped, and do hope, more
proudly of Davy than of any other man; and as he
has been endeared to me more than any other man,
by the being a Thing of Hope to me (more, far more
than myself to my own self in my most genial moments,)&mdash;so
of course my disappointment would be
proportionally severe. It were falsehood, if I said
that I think his present situation most calculated,
of all others, to foster either his genius, or the clearness
and incorruptness of his opinions and moral
feelings. I see two Serpents at the cradle of his
genius, Dissipation with a perpetual increase of acquaintances,
and the constant presence of Inferiors
and Devotees, with that too great facility of attaining
admiration, which degrades Ambition into Vanity&mdash;but
the Hercules will strangle both the reptile
monsters. I have thought it possible to exert
talents with perseverance, and to attain true greatness
wholly pure, even from the impulses of ambition;
but on this subject Davy and I always
differed.</p>

<p>When you used the word "gigantic," you meant,
no doubt, to give me a specimen of the irony I
must expect from my Philo-Lockian critics. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
trust, that I shall steer clear of almost all offence.
My book is not, strictly speaking, metaphysical, but
historical. It perhaps will merit the title of a History
of Metaphysics in England from Lord Bacon
to Mr. Hume, inclusive. I confine myself to facts
in every part of the work, excepting that which
treats of Mr. Hume:&mdash;<cite>him</cite> I have assuredly besprinkled
copiously from the fountains of Bitterness
and Contempt. As to this, and the other works
which you have mentioned, "have patience, Lord!
and I will pay thee all!"</p>

<p>Mr. T. Wedgwood goes to Italy in the first
days of May. Whether I accompany him is uncertain.
He is apprehensive that my health may incapacitate
me. If I do not go with him, (and I shall
be certain, one way or the other, in a few weeks,)
I shall go by myself, in the first week of April, if
possible.</p>

<p>Poole's kindest remembrances I send you on my
own hazard; for he is busy below, and I must fold
up my letter. Whether I remain in England or
am abroad, I will occasionally write you; and am
ever, my dear Purkis, with affectionate esteem,</p>

<p class="signature">Your's sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap j2">S. T. Coleridge</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Remember me kindly to Mrs. Purkis and your
children. T. Wedgwood's disease is not painful:
it is a complete <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tædium vitæ</i>; nothing pleases long,
and novelty itself begins to cease to act like novelty.
Life and all its forms move, in his diseased moments,
like shadows before him, cold, colourless, and
unsubstantial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
From the tone of the following letter, it may
be presumed also, that Mr. Poole, to whom it is
addressed, had expressed some anxiety upon the
dangers to which his flattering station exposed him.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

pleasure and regret.</p>

<p>Be not alarmed, my dear friend, as to the effect

beauties.</p>

<p>My <em>real</em>, my <em>waking</em> existence is amongst the
objects of scientific research: common amusements
and enjoyments are necessary to me only as dreams,
to interrupt the flow of thoughts too nearly analogous
to enlighten and to vivify.</p>

<p>Coleridge has left London for Keswick; during
his stay in town, I saw him seldomer than usual;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
when I did see him, it was generally in the midst of
large companies, where he is the image of power and
activity. His eloquence is unimpaired; perhaps it
is softer and stronger. His will is probably less
than ever commensurate with his ability. Brilliant
images of greatness float upon his mind: like the
images of the morning clouds upon the waters, their
forms are changed by the motion of the waves, they
are agitated by every breeze, and modified by every
sunbeam. He talked in the course of one hour, of
beginning three works, and he recited the poem of
Christobel unfinished, and as I had before heard it.
What talent does he not waste in forming visions,
sublime, but unconnected with the real world! I
have looked to his efforts, as to the efforts of a
creating being; but as yet, he has not even laid
the foundation for the new world of intellectual
forms.</p>

<p>When my Agricultural Lectures are finished, I
propose to visit Paris, and perhaps Geneva. How
I regret that circumstances had not enabled us to
make the same tour at the same time! I think, at
all events, I shall see you before the Autumn, on
your own lands, amidst your own images and
creations.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>Often, very often, in the midst of the tumults
of the multitude in this great city, has my spirit
turned in quietness and solitude towards you.</p>

<p>I hope soon to see you in Somersetshire, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
we may worship Nature, and the spirit that dwells
in Nature, in your green fields and under your tranquil
sky. My communications with you and Coleridge
and Southey, and other ornaments of the great
existing Being, have excited feelings which cheer
me in the apathy of London, and which make me
love human nature.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>Your account of the young man who murdered
his wife, I read with deep interest. It is from such
narratives of the conduct of common persons, that
the laws of simple human nature must be deduced.
Beings acted on by few objects, awakening in them
few but deep passions, are the beings which Metaphysicians
and Moralists ought to study; not those
who exist in general life, having their energies and
feelings so attached to multiplied and indefinite
things&mdash;so mixed up and connected with myriads
of circumstances, as to be imperceptible, unless by
a microscopic moral eye.</p>

<p class="signature">I am, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br />
<span class="smcap j4">H. Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>From the former letter, we learn that Davy, at
this period, proposed delivering some lectures on
the Chemistry of Agriculture. From the memorandums
of my late friend Mr. Arthur Young, the
celebrated Secretary to the Board of Agriculture,
I have succeeded, through the kindness of his daughter,
in procuring the following extracts; the only
source from which I have been able to obtain any
correct information upon this point in his scientific
life.&mdash;"May 15th, 1803. <i>Mem.</i> Two lectures by
Mr. Davy have taken place, and been very well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
attended; they intend retaining him by a salary of
a hundred pounds a year,&mdash;a very good plan."</p>

<p>Amongst the pamphlets at Bradfield Hall is a
small quarto of fourteen pages, entitled, "Outlines
of a Course of Lectures on the Chemistry of Agriculture,
to be delivered before the Board of Agriculture,
1803." It was evidently only printed for
private circulation amongst the members. At the
same time, he printed a small pamphlet, containing
an explanation of the terms used in chemistry, for
the instruction of those amongst his audience who
had not particularly directed their attention to the
science.</p>

<p>The first lecture was delivered on Tuesday, May
the 10th, at twelve at noon, and five others on the
succeeding Tuesdays and Fridays.</p>

<p>In an address to the Board of Agriculture by Sir
John Sinclair, delivered in April 1806, in reviewing
the various objects to which the attention of the
Board had been directed, he thus alludes to the
subject:&mdash;"In the year 1802, when my Lord Carrington
was in the chair, the Board resolved to
direct the attention of a celebrated lecturer, Mr.
Davy, to agricultural subjects; and in the following
year, during the Presidency of Lord Sheffield, he
first delivered to the members of this Institution,
a course of lectures on the <span class="smcap">Chemistry of Agriculture</span>.
The plan has succeeded to the extent
which might have been expected from the abilities
of the gentleman engaged to carry it into effect.
The lectures have hitherto been exclusively addressed
to the Members of the Board; but to such a
degree of perfection have they arrived, that it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
well worthy of consideration, whether they ought
not to be given to a larger audience. If such an
idea met with the approbation of the Board, a hall
might be procured for that purpose, or a special
course of lectures read in this room exclusively for
strangers."</p>

<p>Davy would appear to have been very early impressed
with the importance of Chemistry, in its
various applications to Agriculture. Allusions are
constantly made to it in his letters; and at the
conclusion of his "<span class="smcap">Researches</span>," he glances at this
department of the chemistry of vegetation, and
observes that, "although it is immediately connected
with the art upon which we depend for subsistence,
it has been but little investigated."</p>

<p>In his introductory lecture of 1802, he speaks more
forcibly upon the subject.</p>

<p>"Agriculture, to which we owe our means of
subsistence, is an art intimately connected with chemical
science; for although the common soil of the
earth will produce vegetable food, yet it can only
be made to produce it in the greatest quantity, and
of the best quality, by methods of cultivation dependent
upon scientific principles.</p>

<p>"The knowledge of the composition of soils, of
the food of vegetables, of the modes in which their
products must be treated, so as to become fit for the
nourishment of animals, is essential to the cultivator
of land; and his exertions are profitable and useful
to society, in proportion as he is more of a chemical
professor. Since indeed the truth has been understood,
and since the importance of agriculture has
been generally felt, the character of the agriculturist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
has become more dignified, and more refined;&mdash;no
longer a mere machine of labour, he has learned to
think, and to reason. He is aware of his usefulness
to his fellow-men, and he is become, at once, the
friend of nature, and the friend of society."</p>

<p>His appointment, as chemical professor to the
Board of Agriculture, was accompanied with the
obligation of reading lectures before its members;
which he continued to deliver every successive
season for ten years, modifying and extending their
views, from time to time, in such a manner as
the progress of chemical discovery might render
necessary.</p>

<p>These discourses were collated, and published in
the year 1813, at the request of the President and
members of the Board, and they form the only
systematic work we, at present, possess on the subject.
Its views, however, are too generally interesting
to be briefly dismissed; I shall therefore enter
more fully into their merits in a more advanced
part of these memoirs.</p>

<p>His connexion with the Board necessarily brought
him in contact with the practical agriculturists and
capitalists of the day, with many of whom he
formed friendships which lasted through life. With
Mr. Coke of Holkham he became well acquainted,
and generally formed one of the party at his annual
sheep-shearing.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> He was also a frequent visitor at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Woburn, and received from the Duke the means
by which he was enabled to submit to the test of
practice various theories which his science had
suggested.</p>

<p>In a letter to Mr. Gilbert, dated October 1803,
he says: "I have just quitted the coast of Sussex,
where I have spent the last three weeks with Lord
Sheffield, the worthy biographer of Gibbon." In
fact, there was not a nobleman, distinguished for
intellectual superiority, who did not feel a pride in
receiving him as a guest; and he passed his vacations
in the society of those exalted persons who, in
possessing rank, fortune, and talents, felt that they
only held such gifts from Providence, in trust for
the welfare of their fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>We can scarcely picture to ourselves a being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
upon whom fortune ever showered more favours
than upon Davy, during this golden period of his
career. Independent in an honourable competence,
the product of his genius and industry; resident in
the centre of all scientific information and intelligence;
every avenue of knowledge, and every mode
of observation open to his unwearied intellect, he
must have experienced a satisfaction which few philosophers
have ever before felt,&mdash;the power of pursuing
experimental research to any extent, and of
commanding the immediate possession of all the
means it might require, without the least regard
either to cost or labour. What a contrast does this
picture afford to that which has been too faithfully
represented as the more usual fate of the philosopher
and man of letters, and which exhibits little more
than the unavailing struggles of genius against penury!
Instead of a life consumed in fruitless expectation
of patronage and reward, we behold Davy,
in the full bloom of reputation, courted by all whom
rank, talent, or station, had rendered conspicuous.</p>

<p>His life flowed on like a pure stream, under a
sky of perpetual sunshine,&mdash;not a gust ruffled its
surface, not a cloud obscured its brightness. In the
morning, he was the sage interpreter of Nature's
laws; in the evening, he sparkled in the galaxy of
fashion; and not the least extraordinary point in
the character of this great man, was the facility
with which he could cast aside the cares of study,
and enter into the trifling amusements of society.&mdash;"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne
otium quidem otiosum</i>," was the exclamation of
Cicero; and it will generally apply to the leisure of
men actively engaged in the pursuits of science; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Davy, in closing the door of his laboratory, opened
the temple of pleasure. When not otherwise engaged,
his custom was to play at billiards, frequent
the theatre, or read the last new novel. In ordinary
cases, the genius of evening dissipation is an arrant
Penelope; but Davy, on returning to his morning
labours, never found that the thread had been unspun
during the interruption.</p>

<p>The following anecdote is well calculated to illustrate
that versatility of talent of which I have frequently
spoken, as well as the power he possessed
of abstracting himself, without detriment, from the
most elaborate investigations. A friend of the late
Mr. Tobin called upon him at the Institution, and
found him deeply engaged in the laboratory; their
conversation turned upon "The Honey Moon,"
which was to be brought out on the following
evening.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> No sooner had Davy heard that, although
pressing applications had been made to several
of the poets of the day, a Prologue had not
yet been written, than he instantly quitted the laboratory,
and in two hours produced that which was
recited on the occasion by Mr. Bartley, and printed
in the first edition of the comedy. I insert it in
this place.</p>

<p>Davy would appear to have frequently amused
himself with writing sonnets, and inclosing them in
letters to his several friends: the following letter
will also show that he was ambitious of being considered
a poet.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO SAMUEL PURKIS, ESQ.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR PURKIS,</p>

<p>I inclose the little poem,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> on which your praise
has stamped a higher value, I fear, than it deserves.</p>

<p>If I thought that people in general would think
as favourably of my poetical productions, I would
write more verses, and would write them with more
care; but I fear you are partial: I am very glad,
however, that you like the little song; at some
future period I will send you another.</p>

<p>With kind remembrances, unalterably your sincere
friend,</p>

<p class="signature smcap">H. Davy.</p>
</div>

<p>On examining the laboratory notes made at this
period, many of which, however, are nearly illegible
from blots of ink and stains of acid, it would appear
that his researches into the composition of mineral
bodies were most extensive, and that he obtained
many new results, of which he does not seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
have availed himself in any of his subsequent papers.
To borrow a metaphor from his favourite
amusement, he treated such results as small fry,
which he returned to their native element to grow
bigger, or to be again caught by some less aspiring
brother of the angle.</p>

<p>Had Davy, at this period of his life, been anxious
to obtain wealth,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> such was his chemical reputation,
and such the value attached to his judgment, that,
by lending his assistance to manufacturers and projectors,
he might easily have realized it; but his
aspirations were of a nobler kind&mdash;<span class="smcap">Scientific
Glory</span> was the grand object for which his heart
panted: by stopping to collect the golden apples,
he might have lost the race.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="hanging">Sir Thomas Bernard allots Davy a piece of ground for Agricultural
Experiments.&mdash;History of the Origin of the Royal Institution.&mdash;Its
early labours.&mdash;Davy's Letters to Mr. Gilbert and to Mr.
Poole.&mdash;Death of Mr. Gregory Watt.&mdash;Davy's passion for Fishing,

on the subject.&mdash;His paper on the Analysis of the Wavellite.&mdash;His
Memoirs on a new method of analysing Minerals which contain
a fixed Alkali.&mdash;Reflections on the discovery of Galvanic
Electricity.</p>

<p>Very shortly after Davy had arrived in London,
he formed an intimate friendship with Mr. (afterwards
Sir Thomas) Bernard; and no sooner had he
directed his attention to the subject of Philosophical
Agriculture, than the worthy Baronet allotted
him a considerable piece of ground near his villa at
Roehampton, where, under his sole direction, numerous
experiments were tried, many of which
proved highly successful, and afterwards served for
the illustration of various subjects in his work on
<span class="smcap">Agricultural Chemistry</span>.</p>

<p>Although devoted as Davy was to the pursuits
of science, he entered warmly into all political plans
for improving the condition of the people, and
advancing the progress of civilization. "No one,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
says his friend Mr. Poole, "was less a sectarian,
if I may use the word, in religion, politics, or in
science. He regarded with benevolence the sincere
convictions of any class on the subject of belief,
however they might differ from his own. In politics,
he was the ardent friend of rational liberty.
He gloried in the institutions of his country, and
was anxious to see them maintained in their purity
by timely and temperate reform." Indeed, in carefully
analysing his mind, and tracing its developement,
it appears that benevolence was one of its
leading elements; the form in which it displayed
its energies varying with the varying conditions of
intelligence. In boyish life, his imagination, acting
upon his zeal for the welfare of his species, delighted,
as we have seen, in the ideas of encountering
dragons, and quelling the might of giants; but as
fancy paled with the light of advancing years, and
the judgment, presented distincter appearances, the
philanthropic antipathy which had been directed to
those chimeras of the nursery, was transferred to
the two great oppressions of society, and in Superstition
he saw the dragons&mdash;in Despotism, the giants
that spread mischief and misery through the world.</p>

<p>Some of his early manuscripts are still in existence;
and I shall here introduce a passage from one
which has been lately transmitted to me by a gentleman
resident in Penzance. The most trifling record
becomes interesting, when we can trace in it the
germ of a particular opinion, or the first symptom of
a quality which may afterwards have distinguished
its possessor.</p>

<p>"Science is as yet in her infancy; but in her infancy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
she has done much for man. The discoveries
hitherto so beneficial to mankind have been generally
effected by the energies of individual minds:&mdash;what
hopes may we not entertain of the rapid progress
of the happiness of man when illumination
shall become general&mdash;when the united powers of
a number of scientific men shall be employed in
discovery! Every thing seems to announce the
rapid advance of this period of improvement. The
time is approaching when despotism and superstition,
those enormous chains that have so long enfettered
mankind, shall be annihilated,&mdash;when liberated
man shall display the mental energies for which he
was created. At that period, nations shall know
that it is their interest to cultivate science, and that
the benevolent philosophy is never separated from
the happiness of mankind."</p>

<p>In his published writings, we discover evidences
of the same tendency; he suffers no opportunity to
escape which can enable him to enforce his principle,
and he extracts from the most common as well as
from the least probable sources, comparisons and
analogies for its illustration. The ingenuity with
which this is accomplished often surprises and delights
us; the effect upon the reader is frequently
not unlike that occasioned by the flashes of wit, to
which it surely must be closely allied, if wit be
correctly defined by Johnson "a combination of
dissimilar images, or the discovery of occult resemblances
in things apparently unlike." Is not this
opinion strikingly illustrated by the happy turn
given to his observations "upon the process of obtaining
nitrous oxide from nitre,"&mdash;when he says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
"Thus, if the hopes which these experiments induce
us to indulge do not prove fallacious, a substance
which has heretofore been almost exclusively appropriated
to the destruction of mankind, may become,
in the hands of philosophy, the means of producing
health and pleasure!"</p>

<p>Mr. Poole, who watched the whole of his progress
from obscurity to distinction, and enjoyed his friendship
for nearly thirty years, says, "To be useful to
science and mankind was, to use his favourite
expression, the pursuit in which he gloried. He
was enthusiastically attached to science, and to men
of science; and his heart yearned to promote their
interests."</p>

<p>That Davy, with a mind so constituted, should
have formed a strong and ardent attachment to Sir
Thomas Bernard, and that this friendship should
have been reciprocally cultivated, cannot be a matter
of surprise.</p>

<p>I am happy in this opportunity of paying a tribute
of respect to the memory of this most excellent
person, with whom I had the pleasure of being well
acquainted. His life was one continued scheme of
active benevolence; and he merits a particular notice
in these memoirs, as being one of the principal founders
and patrons of the Royal Institution. Actuated
by that noble and rational ambition which makes
private pursuits subservient to public good, he directed
all the energies of his mind, the influence of
his station, and the resources of his wealth, towards
promoting societies and schemes for encouraging the
virtues and industry, and for ameliorating the condition,
of the lower classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
In the beginning of November 1796, in conjunction
with the late Bishop of Durham, Mr. Wilberforce,
and Mr. Elliot, he established the <span class="smcap">Society
for bettering the condition of the Poor</span>.
As one of the primary objects of the original promoters
of this society was the formation of an institution
which might teach the application of science
to the advancement of the arts of life, and to the
increase of domestic comforts, a select committee
was appointed from its body, in January 1799, for
the purpose of conferring with Count Rumford on
the means of carrying such a scheme into practical
effect. This committee consisted of the Earl of
Winchelsea, Mr. Wilberforce, Mr. Sullivan, the
Bishop of Durham, Sir Thomas Bernard, and some
other members of the society; and in a few weeks
they completed the arrangements, circulated printed
proposals, and collected the subscriptions, which
gave birth to the <span class="smcap">Royal Institution of Great
Britain</span>, the future cradle of experimental science,
and the destined scene of Davy's glory.</p>

<p>In addition to the general objects of promoting
the arts and manufactures, and of advancing the
taste and science of the country, its more immediate
purpose was the improvement of the means of industry
and domestic comfort among the poor.</p>

<p>That this benevolent design was constantly kept
in sight may be shown by the several resolutions
passed at the different meetings of the Managers,
especially at that held in March 1800; when it was
resolved to appoint <em>fourteen</em> different committees,
for the purpose of scientific investigation and improvement;
amongst which were the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
"For the investigation into the processes of
making bread, and into the methods of improving it.</p>

<p>"For enquiring into the art of preparing cheap
and nutritious soups for feeding the poor.</p>

<p>"For improving the construction of cottages, and
cottage fire-places, and for improving kitchen fire-places,
and kitchen utensils.</p>

<p>"For ascertaining, by experiment, the effects of the
various processes of cookery upon the food of cattle.</p>

<p>"For improving the construction of lime-kilns,
and the composition of mortar and cements," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>So that the foundation and original arrangements
of the Royal Institution were not only calculated to
extend the boundaries of science, but to increase
its applications, and to promote and improve those
arts of life on which the subsistence of all, and the
comfort and enjoyment of the great majority of
mankind absolutely depend.</p>

<p>At this early period of its history, the Royal
Institution presented a scene of the most animated
bustle and exhilarating activity. Persons most distinguished
in the various departments of science and
art were to be seen zealously and liberally co-operating
for the promotion and diffusion of public
happiness, under the cheering beams of popular
favour and exalted patronage. It was like 'a busy
ant-hill in a calm sunshine.'</p>

<p>I shall only add, that Sir Thomas Bernard was
the original promoter of the "School for the Indigent
Blind;" of an institution for the protection
and instruction of "Climbing Boys;" of a society
for the relief of "Poor Neighbours in Distress;"
of the "Cancer Institution;" and of the "London

The philanthropic Baronet was, moreover, the
founder of the "British Institution," for promoting
the Fine Arts in the United Kingdom; and he was
also the originator of the "Alfred Club."</p>

<p>The vast range and practical utility of these exertions
were duly appreciated by his contemporaries,
who were ever ready to promote any scheme which
had received the sanction of his patronage. It is an
anecdote worthy of being preserved, that the late
Sir Robert Peel called upon him one morning, and
after a general conversation on the different philanthropic
objects they had in view, said on leaving the
room, he had to request that Sir Thomas would dispose
of something for him, in any manner he thought
most serviceable, and laid on the table an enclosure.
After he had left the house, Sir Thomas was greatly
surprised, on opening it, to find a bank-note of a
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The active zeal of Sir T. Bernard, like every other
circumstance which exceeds the ordinary standard of
our conduct, or becomes prominent from the rarity
of its occurrence, called forth the wit as well as the
admiration of his contemporaries. One of those
modern travellers who delight in astonishing their
auditors by incredible tales and marvellous anecdotes,
happening to be in company with a noble
lord as much distinguished for the playfulness of
his wit as for the profundity of his learning, told
the following improbable story: that, in a sequestered
part of Italy, when pressed by hunger and
fatigue, he sought refreshment and repose in a wild
dwelling in the mountains, and was agreeably surprised
at being offered a pie; but, horror of horrors!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
on examining its contents he found&mdash;a human
finger!&mdash;"Nothing more probable, Sir," interrupted
his Lordship; "and I well know the person to
whom that finger belonged&mdash;to Sir Thomas Bernard,
Sir, for he had a finger in every pie."</p>

<p>The following letters will be read in this place
with interest.</p>

<p class="center">TO DAVIES GIDDY, ESQ.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>I am now on my way to Christchurch, in company
with Mr. Bernard, who was the founder, and
has been the great supporter, of the Society for bettering
the condition of the Poor.</p>

<p>In a conversation that has just passed between
us, I mentioned the state of improvement of the
Downs between Helston and Marazion, in consequence
of grants of small portions of land to
miners and other tenants for cultivation, many of
which have, I believe, been made by Lord Dunstanville.
Mr. Bernard expressed a desire to know
what the effect of this plan had been on the condition
of the persons thus raised into "property-men."</p>

<p>He is accumulating facts as to the manner in
which the poor have been most effectually benefited,
and to assist his labour would be to assist a good
and most important cause; perhaps, you will have
the goodness to give me a statement on this subject,
which of course shall be used as you may think
proper. You may likewise have similar facts nearer
home, on your own estates.</p>

<p>I am convinced that the effects of enabling the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
common labourer to acquire property must be striking,
and must often have been an object of your
contemplation.</p>

<p>In making any statement of these facts, you
will probably think it right to mention some particular
cases, with dates, names, and accounts of the
quantities of lands, the nature of the improvements,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>In the reports of the "Society for bettering the
condition of the Poor," there is one made on this
minute plan of Lord Winchelsea's grants of land
to cottagers, which conveys very full and useful
information.</p>

<p>I trust to your kindness, and believe me</p>

</div>

<p>The following letter was written by Davy after
his return from an excursion to that beautiful district,
the north-west of the county of Somerset.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">  October, 1804.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">returned</span> to town a little while ago, not sorry
to see the great city of activity and life; not sorry
to see it, though I had just spent two months in
enjoying a scenery beautiful and, to me, new; in
witnessing much hospitality and unadulterated manners,
and in gaining much useful information.</p>

<p>Mr. Bernard is writing a history of the poor. I
have lived much with him at Roehampton since my
return, and he has read to me part of his work,
which is popularly eloquent, very intelligent, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
full of striking and important truths; but pray say
nothing of this, for it is likely that it will appear
without his name: the facts will be strong, and
perhaps to some people offensive.</p>

<p>I have received a letter from Coleridge within the
last three weeks: he writes from Malta, in good
spirits, and, as usual, from the depth of his being.
God bless him!&mdash;He was intended for a great man;
I hope and trust he will, at some period, appear
as such.</p>

<p>I am working very hard at this moment, and I
hope soon to send you some of the fruits of my
labours. I am likewise devising some plans at our
Institute, for the improvement of "this generation
of vipers;" but, although I am so vain as to announce
them, I will not be so tedious as to detail
them.</p>

<p>In your answer, which I hope I shall soon receive,
pray give me an account of the situation of "Poole's
Marsh," with regard to the <em>Parrot</em>,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> for I have
mentioned the soil in a paper to the Board of Agriculture,
which is now in the press.</p>

<p class="signature">I am, my dear Poole,<br />
<span class="j2">Your truly affectionate friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap j6">H. Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>In this year, Davy was deprived of one of his
earliest and most attached friends, after a lingering
illness, during which his symptoms, by the alternations
which characterise consumption, had inspired
his friends with hope, only to chill them with despondency;&mdash;Gregory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Watt terminated his earthly
career.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>On the first impression which this melancholy
event produced upon his feelings, Davy wrote a letter
to his friend Clayfield, from which the following
is an extract.</p>

<p>"I scarcely dare to write upon the subject&mdash;I
would fain do what Hamlet does, when, in awe and
horror at the ghost of his father, he attempts to call
up the ludicrous feeling, but being unable to do so,
he merely employs the words which are connected
with it.&mdash;I would be gay, or I would write gaily, in
alluding to the loss we have both sustained, but I
feel that it is impossible. Poor Watt!&mdash;He ought
not to have died. I could not persuade myself that
he would die; and until the very moment when I
was assured of his fate, I would not believe he was
in any danger.</p>

<p>"His letters to me, only three or four months ago,
were full of spirit, and spoke not of any infirmity of
body, but of an increased strength of mind. Why
is this in the order of Nature, that there is such a
difference in the duration and destruction of her
works? If the mere stone decays, it is to produce
a soil which is capable of nourishing the moss and
the lichen; when the moss and the lichen die and
decompose, they produce a mould which becomes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
the bed of life to grass, and to a more exalted species
of vegetables. Vegetables are the food of animals,&mdash;the
less perfect animals of the more perfect; but
in man, the faculties and intellect are perfected,&mdash;he
rises, exists for a little while in disease and misery,
and then would seem to disappear, without an end,
and without producing any effect.</p>

<p>"We are deceived, my dear Clayfield, if we suppose
that the human being who has formed himself
for action, but who has been unable to act, is lost
in the mass of being: there is some arrangement
of things which we can never comprehend, but in
which his faculties will be applied.</p>

<p>"The caterpillar, in being converted into an inert
scaly mass, does not appear to be fitting itself for an
inhabitant of air, and can have no consciousness of
the brilliancy of its future being. We are masters
of the earth, but perhaps we are the slaves of some
great and unknown beings. The fly that we crush
with our finger, or feed with our viands, has no
knowledge of man, and no consciousness of his superiority.
We suppose that we are acquainted with
matter, and with all its elements, and yet we cannot
even guess at the cause of electricity, or explain the
laws of the formation of the stones which fall from
meteors. There may be beings,&mdash;thinking beings,
near us, surrounding us, which we do not perceive,
which we can never imagine. We know very little;
but, in my opinion, we know enough to hope for the
immortality, the <em>individual immortality of the better
part of man</em>.</p>

<p>"I have been led into all this speculation, which
you may well think wild, in reflecting upon the fate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
of Gregory! my feeling has given erring wings to
my mind. He was a noble fellow, and would have
been a great man.&mdash;Oh! there was no reason for his
dying&mdash;he ought not to have died.</p>

<p>"Blessings wait on you, my good fellow! Pray
remember me to Tobin, and, if you read this letter
to him, protest, the moment he begins to argue
against the immortality of man!</p>

<p>"I came yesterday from the borders of Dorsetshire,
where I have been since Monday, seduced to
travel by a friend. I was within sixty miles of you,
and saw divers fair trout-streams: let the fish beware
of me,&mdash;I shall be at them on Monday."</p>

<p>I have included this latter sentence in my extract,
as being highly characteristic of the writer. His
passion for angling betrayed itself upon all occasions;
and the sport was alike his relief in toil, and
his solace in sorrow. To his conversation, as well as
to his letters, we may aptly apply the words of the
Augustan poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Desinit in piscem&mdash;&mdash;formosa superne."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Whenever I had the honour of dining at his table,
the conversation, however it might have commenced,
invariably ended on fishing; and when a brother of
the angle happened to be present, you had the pleasure
of hearing all his encounters with the finny
tribe&mdash;how he had lured them by his treachery, and
vanquished them by his perseverance. He would
occasionally strike into a most eloquent and impassioned
strain upon some subject which warmed his
fancy; such, for example, as the beauties of mountain
scenery; but before you could fully enjoy the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
prospect which his imagination had pictured, down
he carried you into some sparkling stream, or rapid
current, to flounder for the next half hour with a
hooked salmon!</p>

<p>I remember witnessing, upon one of these occasions,
a very amusing scene, which may be related
as illustrative of some peculiarities of his temper. I
believe all those who have accompanied Davy in
his fishing excursions, will allow that no sportsman
was ever more ambitious to appear skilful and lucky.
Nothing irritated him so much as to find that his
companions had caught more fish than himself; and
if, during conversation, a brother fisherman surpassed
him in the relation of his success, he betrayed similar
impatience.</p>

<p>There happened to be present, on the occasion to
which I allude, a skilful angler, and an enterprising
chemist. The latter commenced on some subject
connected with his favourite science; but Davy,
who, generally speaking, disliked to make it a subject
of conversation, suddenly turned to the angler, and
related what he considered a very surprising instance
of his success: his sporting friend, however, mortified
him by the relation of a still more marvellous
anecdote; upon which Davy as quickly returned to
the chemist, who, in turn, again sent him back to
the angler:&mdash;and thus did he appear to endure the
unhappy fate of the <em>flying fish</em>, who no sooner
escapes from an enemy in the regions of air, than he
is pursued by one equally rapacious in the waters.&mdash;But
to return to the thread of our history.</p>

<p>In referring to the records of the Institution, it
appears that in January 1805, Davy greatly enriched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
the cabinets of the Institution by a present of
minerals. The following are the Minutes of the
Committee upon this occasion:</p>

<p>"January 21, 1805.&mdash;Mr. Hatchett reported that,
in pursuance of the request of the Managers, he had
inspected the minerals presented to the Royal Institution
by Mr. Davy, and that the aggregate value
(including the duplicate specimens) appears to him
to exceed one hundred guineas."</p>

<p>"January 28.&mdash;The Managers took into consideration
Mr. Hatchett's report at the last meeting, and
resolved that Mr. Davy is entitled to the thanks of
the Managers for having added so valuable a present
to the collection of minerals belonging to the
Institution."</p>

<p>On the 4th of February, it was Resolved&mdash;"That
Mr. Davy be appointed Director of the Laboratory,
at a salary of one hundred pounds a-year; by which
his annual income from the Institution was raised to
four hundred pounds. At this period he delivered
a series of lectures on Geology, or on the chemical
history of the earth; to which we find an allusion in
the following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> very much obliged to you for your last
kind letter, and I thank you most sincerely for the
exertion of your friendship at Bath. I thank you
with very warm feelings.</p>

<p>I hope you will soon come to town; that you will
stay a long time; and that we shall be very much
together.</p>

I paid your subscription to Arthur Young for
the Smithfield Club. Pray, at all times, command
me to do any thing I can for you in London:&mdash;you
cannot teaze me; and though I am a very idle fellow,
yet I can always work if the stimulus be the
desire of serving such a friend as yourself.</p>

<p>I am giving my course of lectures on Geology to
very crowded audiences. I take a great interest in
the subject; and I hope the information given will
be useful.</p>

<p>There has been no news lately from Coleridge;
the last accounts state that he was well in the autumn,
and in Sicily. On that poetic ground, we
may hope and trust that his genius will call forth
some new creations, and that he may bring back
to us some garlands of never-dying verse. I have
written to urge him strongly to give a course of
lectures on Poetry at the Royal Institution, where
his feeling would strongly impress, and his eloquence
greatly delight. I am, my dear Poole, most
affectionately</p>

<p>On the 20th of May, in this year, Mr. Hatchett
reported to the Managers of the Institution&mdash;"that
Mr. Davy proposed making a journey into Wales
and Ireland this summer, having in view to collect
specimens for enriching the mineralogical cabinets;"
in consequence of which it was Resolved&mdash;"That
the sum of one hundred pounds be entrusted to Mr.
Davy to purchase minerals, and to defray the incidental
charges; and that the boy of the Laboratory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
William Reeve,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> be ordered to attend him on his
tour, and that the steward be directed to defray his
expenses.</p>

<p>From the following letters, it would appear that,
having accomplished his purpose of visiting Ireland,
he made a rapid journey into Cornwall for the sake
of seeing his mother and sisters.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO DAVIES GIDDY, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">  Okehampton, September 1805.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>I am accompanying my friend Mr. Bernard in a
tour through the West of England, and I hope we
shall reach Penzance in two or three days.</p>

<p>Mr. Bernard wishes much for the honour of your
acquaintance, and I trust you will permit me to
have the pleasure of making you known to him.
Much kindness and long knowledge of him, may
have made me partial to that gentleman, and may
perhaps influence me when I say, that there is not
a more patriotic, good, and public-spirited man in
Great Britain.</p>

<p>I came from Ireland by the western road, about a
fortnight ago. My expectations were fully satisfied
with the appearances of the "Giant's Causeway."
The arrangements of rocks of the Northern Cape of
Ireland appear to me to present facts equally irreconcilable
upon either the Plutonic or Neptunian
theory; and I am convinced that general fanciful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
theories will lose ground in proportion as minute
observations are multiplied.</p>

<p>The Irish are a noble race, degraded by slavery,
and bearing the insignia of persecution, extreme savageness,
or the lowest servility; yet they are ingenious
and active, and seem to me to possess all the
elements of power and usefulness; but amongst the
lower orders there is a most unfortunate equality,
destructive of all great and efficient exertion; and
amongst the higher classes the greatest degree of
activity is awakened only by the desire of imitating
the English, and that not so much in their virtues
and talents, as in their luxuries and follies.</p>

<p>I hear from all quarters of the good effects of
your late exertions in Parliament. May your efforts
tend to establish the reign of good sense and pure
philosophy, in a place where they have been too
often found to yield to empty sounds!</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">MADE</span> a very rapid journey to Cornwall with
Mr. Bernard, merely for the sake of showing him
the country, and for the purpose of spending a
week with my mother and sisters.</p>

<p>We made an effort to come to you at Nether
Stowey, but the people at Bridgewater would not
take us round, through Stowey, to Taunton, without
four horses; and at all events we could only
have spent two or three hours with you; and it is
difficult to say whether the pleasure of meeting, or
the regret at parting so soon, would have been the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
greatest. I long very much for the intercourse of
a week with you. I have very much to say about
Ireland. It is an island which might be made a
new and a great country. It now boasts a fertile
soil, an ingenious and robust peasantry, and a rich
aristocracy; but the bane of the nation is the equality
of poverty amongst the lower orders. All are
slaves without the probability of becoming free;
they are in the state of equality which the <i>Sansculottes</i>
wished for in France; and until emulation
and riches, and the love of clothes and neat houses,
are introduced amongst them, there will be no permanent
improvement.</p>

<p>Changes in political institutions can at first do
little towards serving them. It must be by altering
their habits, by diffusing manufactories, by destroying
<em>middle-men</em>, by dividing farms,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and by promoting
industry by making the pay proportioned to the
work. But I ought not to attempt to say any thing
on the subject when my limits are so narrow; I
hope soon to converse with you about it.</p>

<p>I found much to interest me in geology in Ireland,
and I have brought away a great deal of information,
and many specimens.</p>

<p>I shall now be in London till Christmas, with the
exception of next week, which I am obliged to pass
in Bedfordshire. I am, my dear Poole,</p>

After the Giant's Causeway, the scenery which
called forth Davy's greatest admiration in Ireland
was that of Fair-Head. To an enthusiastic lover of
the wild and sublime features of Nature, an object
of greater interest could scarcely be presented than
a vast promontory, the summit of which rises five
hundred feet above the sea, and at whose base lies
a waste of rude and gigantic columns, swept by the
hand of Time from the mountain to which they
formerly belonged.</p>

<p>The following fragment, written by Davy at the
time, has been placed in my hands by Mr. Greenough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Amongst Davy's letters to Mr. Gilbert, in the
years 1804 and 1805, I find several upon the subject
of the elastic force of steam, at different temperatures,
with reference to Mr. Trevitheck's improvements
in the steam-engine; in one of which he says,
"I shall be extremely happy to hear of the results
of your enquiries, and I hope you will not confine
them to your friends, but make them public. Whenever
speculative leads to practical discovery, it ought
to be well remembered, and generally known: one
of the most common arguments against the philosophical
exercise of the understanding is, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cui bono?</i>
It is an absurd argument, and every fact against it
ought to be carefully registered. Trevitheck's engine
will not be forgotten; but it ought to be known
and remembered that your reasonings and mathematical
enquiries led to the discovery."</p>

<p>On the 28th of February 1805, was read before
the Royal Society, and published in the Transactions
of that year, a paper entitled, "An Account of
some analytical Experiments on a mineral production
from Devonshire, consisting principally of Alumina
and Water; by Humphry Davy, &amp;c."</p>

<p>This mineral was first discovered by Dr. Wavel,
in small veins and cavities, in a tender argillaceous
slate, near Barnstaple in Devonshire. At first it
was considered as a species of <em>Zeolite</em>, until Mr.
Hatchett concluded, from its geological position,
that it did not belong to that family of minerals.
Dr. Babington subsequently suspected from its physical
characters, and from some of its habitudes with
acids, that it was a mineral not before described, and
accordingly placed a quantity of it in Davy's hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
for analysis; who, on finding in its composition
little more than clay and water, proposed to change
the name of <em>Wavellite</em> for that of <em>Hydrargyllite</em>, as
better expressive of its chemical nature. He however,
at the same time, alludes to traces of an acid
which he was unable to identify.</p>

<p>In a letter to Mr. Nicholson, dated Killarney,
June 15, 1806, and which was afterwards published
in his Journal, Davy refers to this fact in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="opening">DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">SHALL</span> feel much obliged to you to mention
that I have found the acid which exists in minute
quantities in Wavellite to be the <em>Fluoric acid</em>, in
such a peculiar state of combination as not to be
rendered sensible by sulphuric acid. I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature smcap">H. Davy.</p>
</div>

<p>My late friend the Reverend William Gregor,
having found the Wavellite at Stenna Gwynn, in
Cornwall, submitted it to experiment, and the result
certainly established the conclusion of the presence
of fluoric acid, though not rendered apparent by
the usual tests. The facts were transmitted to the
Royal Society, and published in a paper entitled,
"On a mineral Substance, formerly supposed to be
Zeolite; by the Reverend William Gregor."</p>

<p>The subsequent experiments of Berzelius, however,
cleared away the obscurity in which the subject
was still involved. He showed that this mineral
not only contained in its composition a small portion
of the <em>neutral fluate of alumina</em>, but he demonstrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
the presence of a <em>sub-phosphate</em> of that earth, to no
inconsiderable an amount. Much has been said of the
error committed on this occasion by Davy, in overlooking
thirty-three per cent. of phosphoric acid;
but the <em>phosphate of alumina</em> is a body that might
very easily have escaped notice at a period when
mineral analysis was in a far less advanced state than
it is at present.</p>

<p>On the 16th of May 1805, Davy communicated
to the Royal Society a paper "On the method of
analyzing Stones containing a fixed Alkali, by means
of the Boracic Acid." This method was founded
upon two important facts: first, on the considerable
attraction of boracic acid for the different simple
earths at the heat of ignition; and, secondly, on the
facility with which the compounds so formed are
decomposed by the mineral acids. The processes
are extremely simple, and the method must be
considered as having advanced the art of mineral
analysis.</p>

<p>For this and his preceding papers, the President
and Council of the Royal Society adjudged to him
their Copley medal.</p>

<p>In 1806, Mr. Poole, having consulted Davy on
the subject of a Mine occurring near Nether Stowy,
received from him the following letter, which is
interesting from the political opinions it displays.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>What you have written concerning the indifference
of men with regard to the interest of the
species in future ages, is perfectly just and philosophical;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
but the greatest misfortune is, that men
do not attend even to their own interest, and to the
interest of their own age in public matters. They
think in moments, instead of thinking, as they ought
to do, in years; and they are guided by expediency
rather than by reason. The true political maxim is,
that the good of the whole community is the good
of every individual; but how few statesmen have
ever been guided by this principle! In almost all
governments, the plan has been to sacrifice one part
of the community to other parts:&mdash;sometimes, the
people to the aristocracy; at other times, the aristocracy
to the people;&mdash;sometimes, the Colonies to the Mother-country;
and at other times, the Mother-country
to the Colonies. A generous enlightened
policy has never existed in Europe since the days
of Alfred; and what has been called "the balance of
power"&mdash;the support of civilization,&mdash;has been produced
only by jealousy, envy, bitterness, contest,
and eternal war, either carried on by pens or cannon,
destroying men morally and physically! But if I
proceed in vague political declamation, I shall have
no room left for the main object of my letter&mdash;your
Mine. I wish it had been in my power to write
decidedly on the subject; but your county is a
peculiar one: such indications would be highly favourable
in Cornwall; but in a <em>shell-limestone</em> of
late formation, there have as yet been no instances
of great copper mines. I hope, however, that your
mine will produce a rich store of <em>facts</em>.</p>

<p>Miners from Alston Moor, or from Derbyshire,
would understand your country better than Cornish
miners, for the Cornish shifts are wholly different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
from yours. It would be well for you to have some
workmen at least from the North, as they are well
acquainted with <em>shell-limestone</em>.</p>

<p>The Ecton copper mine in Staffordshire is in this
rock: it would be right for you to get a plan and
a history of that mine, which might possibly assist
your views.</p>

<p>Had I been rich, I would adventure; but I am
just going to embark with all the little money I
have been able to save for a scientific expedition to
Norway, Lapland, and Sweden. In all climes, I
shall be your warm and sincere friend,</p>

<p class="signature smcap">H. Davy.</p>
</div>

<p>On the death of Dr. Edward Whitaker Gray,
Secretary of the Royal Society, Davy was elected
into that office, at an extraordinary meeting of the
Society, on the 22nd of January 1807; and at the
same time he was elected a member of the Council.</p>

<p>We are now advancing to that brilliant period in
the history of our philosopher, at which he effected
those grand discoveries in science, which will transmit
his name to posterity, associated with those of
Newton, Bacon, Locke, and the great master-spirits
of every age and country:&mdash;I speak of his developement
of the <span class="smcap">Laws of Voltaic Electricity</span>.</p>

<p>I approach the subject with that diffidence which
the contemplation of mighty achievements must
ever produce in the mind of the historian, when he
compares the extent and magnitude of his subject
with the limited and feeble powers which are to
describe them.</p>

<p>As the advantages afforded by the history of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
great discovery consist as much in exhibiting, step
by step, the intellectual operations by which it was
accomplished, as in detailing its nature and applications,
or in examining its relations with previously
established truths; so shall I be unable to preserve
a chronological succession in the examination of
those several memoirs which he presented to the
Royal Society, without breaking asunder that fine
intellectual thread, by which his mind was conducted
through the intricate paths of nature from
known to unknown phenomena. For this reason,
although I announced, according to the date of its
publication, the subject of his first paper on electricity,
I deferred entering upon its examination,
until I might be able to bring into one uninterrupted
view the whole enquiry, in all its branches
and bearings.</p>

<p>It is impossible to enter upon the subject of galvanism,
or Voltaic electricity, without recurring to
the circumstance which first betrayed the existence
of such an energy in nature, and to the sanguine expectations
which the discovery so naturally excited.</p>

<p>On witnessing the powerful contraction of a muscular
fibre by the mere contact of certain metals, it
was rational to conclude, that the nature and operation
of the mysterious power of vital irritability
might, at length, be discovered by a new train of
scientific research. It is a curious fact, that an
experiment so full of promise to the physiologist
should have hitherto failed in affording him any
assistance in his investigations; while the chemist,
to whom it did not, at first, appear to offer any one
single point of interest, has derived from it a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
and highly important instrument of research, which
has already, under the guidance of Davy, multiplied
discoveries with such rapidity, and to such an extent,
that it is not even possible to anticipate the
limits of its power.</p>

<p>We have here, then, another striking instance of
a great effect produced by means apparently insignificant.
Who could have imagined it possible,
that the spasmodic action occasioned in the limb of
a frog, by the accidental contact of a pair of scissors,
should have become the means of changing the
whole theory of chemistry&mdash;of discovering substances,
whose very existence was never suspected&mdash;of
explaining the anomalous associations of mineral
bodies in the veins of the earth&mdash;of protecting
surfaces of metal from the corrosive action of the
elements&mdash;of elucidating the theories of volcanoes
and earthquakes&mdash;and, may we not add? of leading
the way to a knowledge of the laws of terrestrial
magnetism!</p>

<p>Such an unexpected extension of an apparently
useless fact should dispose us to entertain a kinder
regard for the labours of one another, and teach us
to judge with diffidence of the abstract results of
science. A discovery which may appear incapable
of useful application to-day, may be our glory to-morrow,&mdash;it
may even change the face of empires,
and wield the destiny of nations.</p>

<p>The conic sections of Apollonius Pergæus remained
useless for two thousand years: who could
have supposed that, after the lapse of twenty centuries,
they would have formed the basis of astronomy?&mdash;a
science giving to navigation safety, guiding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
the pilot through unknown seas, and tracing for
him in the heavens an unerring path to his native
shores.</p>

<p>Some apology may be necessary for this digression;
but, I confess, the subject has always appeared
to me to be capable of much interesting illustration,
and I heartily concur in the opinion expressed by
the accomplished author of "Lettres à Sophie"&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Histoire
des grands effets par les petites causes

<p>The History of Galvanism may be divided into
six grand epochs; each being distinguished by the
discovery of facts variously interesting from their
novelty, and from the extent and importance of their
applications.</p>

<p>It cannot be expected that I should enter into a
minute history of the science; such a labour would
require a distinct work for its accomplishment. I
shall therefore follow the plan of the architect, who,
in presenting a finished drawing of a part, sketches
a faint outline of the whole edifice to which it
belongs, in order that its fair proportions may appear
in proper breadth and relief.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">first Epoch</span> may be considered as arising
out of the fundamental fact discovered by Galvani
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
in 1790&mdash;that the contact of two different metals
with the nerve of a recently killed frog will excite
distinct muscular contractions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The second Epoch</span> may be dated from the discovery
of what might be termed <em>Organic</em> Galvanism,
or the production of its influence, without the presence
of animal organs, by the peculiar action of
metals upon water, as first observed by Dr. Ash.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The third Epoch</span> will long be celebrated on
account of the discovery of the accumulation of the
Galvanic power, by the invention of the pile of
Volta, made known in the first year of the present
century, and which so distinctly exhibited the analogy
between Galvanism and Electricity, that the
energy thus excited is now generally spoken of as
"<em>Voltaic Electricity</em>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The fourth Epoch</span> may be considered as founded
upon the knowledge of the general connexion
between the excitement of Voltaic electricity and
chemical changes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The fifth Epoch</span> is exclusively indebted for
its origin to Davy&mdash;the establishment of the general
law, that Galvanism decomposes all compound
bodies, and that the decomposition takes place in a
certain determinate manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The sixth and last Epoch</span> is founded upon
the discovery of the relations subsisting between
electricity and magnetism; giving origin to a new
branch of science, which has been distinguished by
the name of "<span class="smcap">Electro-Magnetism</span>."</p>

<p>Galvani,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> from the moment of his first discovery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
always referred the effects he produced to an electrical
origin; but he considered that the metals employed
merely acted as conductors, which effected
a communication between the different parts of an
animal, naturally, or by some process of nature, in
opposite states of electricity, and that the muscular
contractions took place during the restoration of the
equilibrium.</p>

<p>Until the researches of Dr. Ash,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Ritter, Fabroni,
and Creve, had been made known, the Galvanic
influence was generally considered as existing only
in the living organs of animals, from which it might
be elicited by certain processes.</p>

<p>In the Bakerian Lecture<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> read before the Royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Society in 1826, Davy, in giving a retrospective
view of the progress of Electro-chemical Science,
very justly remarks, that the true origin of all that
has been done in this department of philosophy was
the accidental discovery of Nicholson and Carlisle,
of the decomposition of water by the pile of Volta,
on the 30th of April, in the year 1800; which was
immediately followed by that of the decomposition
of certain metallic solutions, and by the observation
of the separation of alkali on the negative plates of
the apparatus. Mr. Cruickshank, in pursuing these
experiments, obtained many new and important results,
such as the <em>decomposition of the muriates of
magnesia</em>, <em>soda</em>, and <em>ammonia</em>; and also observed
the fact, that alkaline matter always appeared at the
negative, and acid matter at the positive pole.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>No sooner had Davy become acquainted with the
curious experiments of Nicholson and Carlisle, than,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
as we learn from his letter to Mr. Gilbert,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> bearing
the date of July 1800, he proceeded to repeat
them. Indeed, it was the early habit of his mind
not only to originate enquiries, but without delay
to examine the novel results of other philosophers;
and in numerous instances it would seem, that he
only required to confirm their accuracy before he
succeeded in rendering the application of them subservient
to farther discovery. This was certainly
the case with respect to the subject before us: he
was a discoverer as soon as he became an enquirer.
It is admirable to observe with what a quick perception
he discovered the various bearings of a new
fact, and with what ingenuity he appropriated it for
the explanation of previously obscure phenomena.
In referring to the "Additional Observations" appended
to his "Chemical Researches," we shall find
that the moment he became acquainted with the
experiments of Dr. Ash, he proceeded to enquire
how far the fact, previously noticed by himself, of
the conversion of nitrous <em>gas</em> into nitrous <em>oxide</em>, by
exposure to wetted zinc, might depend upon galvanic
action.</p>

<p>In the month of September 1800, he published
his first paper on the subject of Galvanic Electricity,
in Nicholson's Journal, which was followed by six
others, in which he so far extended the original
experiment of Nicholson and Carlisle, as to show
that oxygen and hydrogen might be evolved from
separate portions of water, though vegetable and
even animal substances intervened; and conceiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
that all decompositions might be <em>polar</em>, he electrized
different compounds at the different extremities,
and found that sulphur and metallic bodies appeared
at the <em>negative</em> pole, and oxygen and azote at the
<em>positive</em> pole, though the bodies furnishing them
were separated from each other. Here was the dawn
of the Electro-chemical theory.</p>

<p>In a letter to Mr. Gilbert, already printed in
these Memoirs,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> he announced his opinion that Galvanism
is a process principally chemical; and in a
subsequent communication<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> to the same gentleman,
written on the eve of his departure from Bristol to
the Royal Institution, we discover a farther developement
of the same theory, which, although modified
by future researches, became, as we shall hereafter
find, materially instrumental in establishing juster
views of the nature of Voltaic action.</p>

<p>As soon as it was discovered that galvanic power
might be excited by the contact of metals, without
the interposition of animal organs, it was imagined
that the electricity was set in motion by the contact
of bodies possessing different conducting powers,
without any reference to the chemical action which
accompanied the process. This theory was naturally
suggested by the fact discovered by Mr. Bennett
several years before&mdash;that <em>electricity is excited by the
mere contact of different metals</em>: thus, when a plate
of copper and another of zinc, each furnished with
an insulating glass handle, are made to touch by
their flat surfaces, the zinc, after separation, exhibits
<em>positive</em>, and the copper <em>negative</em> electricity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
In this case, it is fair to conclude that a certain
quantity of electricity had moved from the copper
to the zinc.</p>

<p>On trying other metals, Volta found that similar
phenomena arose; from which property such bodies
have been denominated "<em>motors</em>" of electricity, and
the process which takes place <em>electro-motion</em>: terms
which have since been sanctioned and adopted by
Davy.</p>

<p>It is on this transference of electricity from one
surface to another, by simple contact, that Volta
explains the action of the pile invented by himself,
as well as that of all similar arrangements. The
interposed fluids, on this hypothesis, have no effect
as chemical agents, in producing the phenomena;
they merely act as conductors of the electricity.</p>

<p>We have seen how early Davy had observed the
intimate connexion subsisting between the electrical
effect, and the chemical changes going on in the
pile, and that he accordingly drew the conclusion of
the dependence of the one upon the other. In fact,
the most powerful Voltaic combinations are those
formed by substances that act chemically upon each
other with the greatest energy; while such as
undergo no chemical change exhibit no electrical
powers: thus zinc, copper, and nitric acid form a
powerful battery; whilst silver, gold, and water,
which do not act upon each other, produce no sensible
effect in a series of the same number.</p>

<p>Although, in this obscure region of research, we
are as yet unable to discover the nature of the power
by which electricity is accumulated, it was a considerable
step towards a true theory to have ascertained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the insufficiency of the proposition that had
been offered in explanation of the phenomena.</p>

<p>An investigation into the chemical activity of the
pile led Davy to the discovery of a new series of
facts, to which we find an allusion in his former
letters to Mr. Gilbert, and which subsequently
formed the basis of his first communication read
before the Royal Society on the 18th of June in the
same year.</p>

<p>All the combinations analogous to the Voltaic
pile had hitherto consisted of a series containing, at
least, <em>two</em> metallic bodies, (or one metal and charcoal,)
and a stratum of fluid. Davy discovered that
an accumulation of galvanic energy, exactly similar
to that in the common pile, might be produced by
the arrangement of <em>single</em> metallic plates with <em>different</em>
strata of fluids; so that, instead of composing a
battery with <em>two</em> metals and <em>one</em> fluid, he succeeded
in constructing it with <em>one</em> metal and <em>two</em> fluids;
provided always that oxidation, or some equivalent
chemical change, should proceed on one of the metallic
surfaces only.</p>

<p>In describing these combinations of a single metal
with two fluids, he divides them into three classes,
following in the arrangement the order of time with
regard to their discovery.</p>

<p>In the First Class, one side of the metallic plate
is oxidated; in the Second, a sulphuret is formed on
one of its surfaces; and in the Third, both sides are
acted upon, the metal becoming a <em>sulphuret</em> on one
of its surfaces, and an <em>oxide</em> on the other.</p>

<p>The apparatus which he employed for these experiments
is preserved in the laboratory of the Royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Institution. It consists of a trough, containing
grooves capable of receiving the edges of the different
plates necessary for the arrangement, one half of
which are composed of horn, the other half of some
one metal.</p>

<p>When the apparatus was used, the cells were
filled, in the galvanic order, with the different solutions,
according to the class of the combination, and
connected in pairs with each other by slips of moistened
cloth carried over the non-conducting plates.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the Royal Society, following
that on which the above interesting facts were communicated,
Dr. Wollaston presented a memoir of
considerable importance, entitled, "Experiments on
the Chemical Production and agency of Electricity;"
in which he strongly advocates the truth of
that theory which recognises metallic oxidation as
the <em>primary</em> cause of the Voltaic phenomena. This
paper is also farther important as it proves, by most
ingeniously devised experiments, not only the similarity
of the means by which both common and galvanic
electricity are excited, but also the resemblance
existing between their effects; showing, in fact, that
they are both essentially the same, and confirming
the opinion, that all the apparent differences may
depend upon differences in intensity and quantity.</p>

<p>Acting upon this principle, Dr. Wollaston succeeded
in producing a very close imitation of the
chemical action of galvanism by common electricity;
such, for example, as the decomposition of water,
and other effects of oxidation and deoxidation.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
the prosecution of this train of research, he displays,
in a very striking manner, that attention to minute
arrangement which so remarkably characterised all
his manipulations. I particularly allude to the expedients
by which he reduced the extremity of a
gold wire, in order to apportion the strength of the
electric charge to the quantity of water submitted
to its influence.</p>

<p>Although it is now very generally admitted, that
the chemical agency of the fluids upon the metals
employed is highly essential to the maintenance of
Voltaic action, there still remains considerable doubt
as to how far we are entitled to regard it as the first
in the order of phenomena.</p>

<p>At a later period of his researches, Davy suggested
as a correction, or rather modification, of the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
theory of Volta, that the electro-motion produced
by the contact of the metals might be the primary
cause of the chemical changes; and that such changes
were in no other way efficient, than in restoring the
electric equilibrium thus disturbed: it was farther
held, that this equilibrium could not be permanent,
that it could in fact be only momentary; since, in
consequence of the imperfect conducting power of
the interposed fluid, the zinc and copper-plates, by
their electro-motive power, would again assume their
opposite states of electricity; and that these alternate
changes would occur, as long as any of the
fluid remained undecomposed. In a Voltaic arrangement,
then, there would appear to exist, if the
expression may be allowed, a kind of electrical seesaw;
the apposition of the metals destroying the
equilibrium, and the resulting chemical changes
again restoring it. It has, however, been very justly
observed, that the application of electricity, as an
instrument of chemical decomposition, has most fortunately
no connexion with such theories, and that
the study of its effects may be carried on without
reference to any hypothetical notions concerning the
origin of the phenomena.</p>

<p>An interval of nearly five years had elapsed between
the first communication which Davy made
on this subject, and the Bakerian lecture which is
immediately to be considered. During this period
several new facts had been added by different experimentalists,
but they were scattered, disjointed, and
totally unconnected with each other by any rational
analogies.</p>

<p>The constant appearance of acid and alkaline matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
in pure water, when submitted to the influence
of the Voltaic pile, gave rise to the most extravagant
speculations and discordant hypotheses. Various
statements were made, both in Italy and England,
respecting the <em>generation</em> of muriatic acid, and that
of the fixed alkalies, under these circumstances.
Mr. Sylvester affirmed, that if two separate portions
of water were electrised out of the contact of substances
containing alkaline or acid matter, acid and
alkali would, nevertheless, be produced.</p>

<p>Some philosophers sought to explain the phenomenon
from the salts contained in the fluids of the
trough, which they imagined might, by some unsuspected
channel, find their way into the water
under examination. Others believed that they were
actually <em>generated</em> by the union of the electric fluid
with the water, or with one or both of its elements;
so that, up to the time of Davy's masterly researches,
the subject was involved in the greatest obscurity;
and whether the saline matter was liberated from
unknown combinations, or at once formed by the
union of its elements, was a question upon which
the greatest chemists entertained different opinions.</p>

<p>The Bakerian Lecture, read before the Royal
Society on the 20th of November 1806, not only
set this question for ever at rest, but unfolded the
mysteries of general Voltaic action; and, as far as
theory goes, may almost be said to have perfected
our knowledge of the chemical agencies of the
pile.</p>

<p>This grand display of scientific light burst upon
Europe like a splendid meteor, throwing its radiance
into the deepest recesses, and opening to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
the view of the philosopher new and unexpected
regions.</p>

<p>I shall endeavour to offer as popular a review of
this celebrated memoir, as the abstruse and complicated
nature of its subjects will allow; and I shall
be careful in pointing out the successive stages of
the enquiry; for we are all too much in the habit
of exclusively looking after results; whereas an
examination of the steps by which they were attained
is far more important, not only to the fame
of the discoverer, but to ourselves, as the means of
instruction.</p>

<p>With respect to the first of these divisions, comprehending
a history of the changes produced in
water by electricity, it is worthy of particular notice,
that as early as the year 1800, while residing at
Bristol, Davy had discovered that when separate
portions of distilled water, filling two glass tubes
connected by moist bladders, or any moist animal
or vegetable substance, were submitted to the electrical
action of the Voltaic pile, by means of gold
wires, a <em>nitro-muriatic</em> solution of gold appeared in
the tube containing the positive wire, and a solution
of soda in the opposite tube; but he soon ascertained
that the muriatic acid owed its appearance to the
animal or vegetable matters employed; for when
the same fibres of cotton were used in successive experiments,
and washed after every process in a weak
solution of nitric acid, the water in the apparatus
containing them, though acted upon for a great
length of time with a very strong power, produced
no effect upon a solution of nitrate of silver.</p>

<p>In every case in which he had procured much
soda, the glass<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> at the point of contact with the
wire seemed considerably eroded; when by substituting
an agate for a glass cup, no fixed saline
matter could be obtained. Its source therefore, in
the former case, was evidently the glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
With respect to Mr. Sylvester's experiment, already
noticed, it was sufficient to say that he conducted
his process in a vessel of <em>pipe-clay</em>, which
not only contains lime, but may also include in its
composition some of the combinations of a fixed
alkali.</p>

<p>On resuming the enquiry, it was Davy's first care
to remove every possible source of impurity: he
accordingly procured cups of agate, which, previously
to being filled, were boiled for several hours
in distilled water; and a piece of very white and
transparent <em>amianthus</em>, a substance first proposed for
this purpose by Dr. Wollaston, having been similarly
purified, was made to connect the vessels together.
Thus was every apparent source of fallacy
removed; but still, after having been exposed to
Voltaic action for forty-eight hours, the water in
the positive cup gave indications of muriatic acid,
and that in the negative cup, of soda! The result
was as embarrassing as it was unexpected; but it
was far from convincing him that the bodies thus
obtained were <em>generated</em>:&mdash;but whence arose the
saline matter? Did the agate, after every precaution,
still contain some very minute portion of saline
matter, not easily discoverable by chemical tests?
To determine this question, the experiment was
repeated a second, a third, and a fourth time: the
quantities of saline matter diminished in every successive
operation, which sufficiently proved that the
agate must at least have been <em>one</em> of the sources
sought for; but four additional repetitions of the
process convinced the operator that it could not be
the only one; that there must exist some other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
source from which the alkali proceeded, since it
continued to appear to the last, in quantities sufficiently
distinct, and apparently equal, in every
experiment. This was extremely perplexing: every
precaution had been taken&mdash;the agate cups had
even been included in glass vessels, out of the
reach of the circulating air&mdash;all the acting materials
had been repeatedly washed with distilled water;
and no part of them in contact with the fluid had
ever touched the fingers.</p>

<p>The water itself then, however pure it might
appear, must have furnished the alkali. The experiments
were repeated in cones of the purest gold,
and the water contained in them was submitted to
Voltaic action for fourteen hours; the result was,
that the acid increased in quantity as the experiment
proceeded, and at length became even sour to the
taste. On the contrary, the alkaline properties of
the fluid in the opposite cone shortly obtained a
certain intensity, and remained stationary.</p>

<p>On the application of heat, the alkaline indications
became less vivid, although there always remained,
after the operation, sufficient evidence to
prove that a portion at least was fixed, although
probably mixed with ammonia.</p>

<p>The acid, as far as its properties could be examined,
agreed with those of pure nitrous acid,
having an excess of nitrous gas.</p>

<p>It was now impossible to doubt that the water
held in solution some substance which was capable
of yielding alkaline matter, but which, from the
minuteness of its quantity, had soon been exhausted.</p>

<p>The next step, therefore, was to submit the water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
to a still more rigorous examination, which he did
by evaporating it in a vessel of silver; when he had
the satisfaction to discover the 1-70th of a grain of
saline matter.</p>

<p>The water, thus purified in a vessel of silver, was
again subjected to Voltaic action in the cones of
gold. After two hours, there was only the slightest
possible indication of alkali; and this was not, as
before, <em>fixed</em>, but entirely <em>volatile</em>.</p>

<p>In every one of these experiments, acid matter
had been produced, and it always presented the character
of nitrous acid. Two of the great sources
of foreign matter had been detected and removed,
viz. the vessels, and the water employed; it still
however remained to be explained, how nitrous acid
and ammonia could be produced in cases where pure
water and pure vessels had been used. In no part
of this elaborate enquiry is the penetration of Davy
more striking, than in his reasonings upon this
problem, and in the beautiful experiments which his
sagacity suggested for its solution.</p>

<p>It occurred to him, that the nascent oxygen and
hydrogen of the water might respectively combine
with a portion of the nitrogen of the common air,
which is constantly dissolved in that fluid; but if
this were the case, how did it happen that the production
of nitrous acid was progressive, while that
of the alkali was limited? The experiments of Dr.
Priestley, on the absorption of gases by water, at
once suggested themselves to his mind as being
capable of solving this last difficulty; for that distinguished
philosopher had shown, that hydrogen,
during its solution in water, expelled the nitrogen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
whereas oxygen and nitrogen were capable of coexisting
in a state of solution in that fluid. It was,
however, necessary to confirm the truth of this
explanation by experiment, and he accordingly introduced
the two cones of gold, containing purified
water, under the receiver of an air-pump; the exhaustion
was effected, and the Voltaic pile brought
to act upon the water thus circumstanced; after
eighteen hours the result was examined, when the
water in the negative cone produced no effect upon
prepared litmus, but that in the positive vessel did
give it a tinge of red barely perceptible.</p>

<p>Had his series of experiments terminated here,
the truth of his conclusions would have been established
by the comparatively small proportion of
acid formed in this latter experiment; but he determined
to repeat it under circumstances, if possible,
still more unexceptionable and conclusive. Having,
therefore, arranged the apparatus as before, he exhausted
the receiver, and then filled it with hydrogen
gas from a convenient air-holder; he made
even a second exhaustion, to ensure the highest
accuracy, and then again introduced carefully prepared
hydrogen. The Voltaic process was continued
during twenty-four hours, and at the end of that
period it was found that neither the water in the
positive nor in the negative vessels altered the tint
of litmus in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>Thus did he succeed in exposing the three great
sources of fallacy which had so long misled chemists,
with regard to the generation of acid and alkaline
matter in Voltaic experiments, viz.&mdash;The impurities
of the vessels&mdash;the foreign matter contained in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
water&mdash;and the compounds generated by the combination
of the nitrogen of atmospheric air with the
elements evolved from water; and thus did he
establish, by an unbroken chain of incontrovertible
evidence, the important truth, that "water, chemically
pure, is decomposed by electricity into gaseous
matter alone&mdash;into oxygen and hydrogen."</p>

<p>Out of the foregoing train of research very naturally
sprang the consideration of the <em>decomposing
agencies of Electricity</em>. It had been constantly
observed, that, in all electrical changes connected
with the presence of acid and alkaline matter, the
former uniformly collected around the positive,
and the latter around the negative surface of the
apparatus.</p>

<p>In one of the earliest experiments, Davy had
also noticed that glass underwent decomposition, and
that its alkali always passed to the negative surface.
He was, therefore, led to enquire whether, through
electrical agency, different solid earthy compounds,
insoluble, or soluble with difficulty in water, might
not be made to undergo a similar decomposition.
We shall find that the results of the trials were
decisive and satisfactory. For conducting experiments
of this description, he hit upon the happy
expedient of constructing the cups with the materials
which he wished to submit to experiment, and
then by introducing water into them, and forming
the necessary connexion by means of asbestus, he
completed the Voltaic circuit. In this manner he
submitted to experiment <em>sulphate of lime</em>, <em>sulphate
of strontia</em>, <em>fluate of lime</em>, <em>sulphate of baryta</em>, &amp;c.
and with analogous results; the acid element in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
each case passing to the positive, and the earthy base
to the negative cup.</p>

<p>As, in the above experiments, the bodies under
examination were presented in considerable masses,
and exposed large surfaces to the electric action, it
became necessary to enquire whether minute portions
of acid and alkaline matter could, by the
same agency, be disengaged from solid combinations.
This point was very readily elucidated. A piece
of fine grained basalt, which, by a previous analysis,
had been found to contain 3·5 per cent. of soda,
nearly ·5 of muriatic acid, and fifteen parts of
lime, having been divided into two properly-shaped
pieces, and a cavity, capable of containing twelve
grains of water, been drilled in each, was submitted,
as in former experiments, to the action of the pile.
At the end of ten hours, the result was examined
with care, when it appeared that the positively electrified
water had the strong smell of oxymuriatic
acid, and copiously precipitated nitrate of silver;
while that which was negative affected turmeric,
and left by evaporation a residuum which appeared
to consist of lime and soda.</p>

<p>A part of a specimen of compact zeolite from the
Giants' Causeway, and vitreous lava from Ætna,
were each treated in a similar manner, and with
results equally satisfactory.</p>

<p>Having thus settled the question with regard to
the disengagement of the saline parts of bodies insoluble
in water, he proceeded to extend and multiply
his experiments on soluble compounds, the
decomposition of which, as might have been supposed,
always proceeded with greater rapidity, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
furnished results more perfectly distinct. In these
processes he employed the agate cups, with platina
wires, connected by amianthus moistened with pure
water; the solutions were introduced into these
cups, and the electrifying power applied in the
manner already described. In this way, <em>sulphate
of potash</em>, <em>sulphate of soda</em>, <em>nitrate of potash</em>, <em>phosphate
of soda</em>, &amp;c. were respectively examined; and
in every case the acid, after a certain interval, collected
in the cup containing the positive wire, and
the alkalies and earths in that containing the negative
wire.</p>

<p>When metallic solutions were employed, metallic
crystals or depositions were formed on the negative
wire, and oxide was likewise deposited around it,
while a great excess of acid was found in the opposite
cup.</p>

<p>With respect to the transfer of the constituent
Parts of Bodies by Electric Action, several original
experiments were instituted, and some important
conclusions established.</p>

<p>Several facts had been stated, which rendered it
probable that the saline elements evolved in decompositions
by electricity, were capable of being transferred
from one electrified surface to another, according
to their usual order of arrangement; but
to demonstrate this clearly, farther researches were
required, and Davy proceeded to supply the necessary
evidence. He connected one of the cups of
sulphate of lime before mentioned, with a cup of
agate, by means of asbestus, and filling them with
purified water, connected them with the battery.
In about four hours, a strong solution of lime was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
found in the agate cup, and sulphuric acid in the
cup of sulphate of lime. By reversing the order
of arrangement, and carrying on the process during
a similar period, the sulphuric acid appeared in the
agate cup, and the lime in the opposite vessel. In
both these experiments (the acid in the one case,
and the lime in the other), the elements of the substance
must have passed, in an imperceptible form,
along the connecting line of asbestus into the opposite
vessel.</p>

<p>Many trials were made with other saline bodies,
and with results equally satisfactory; the base always
passing into the vessel rendered negative, and the
acid into that which was positive.</p>

<p>The time required for these transmissions appeared
to be, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris paribus</i>, in some proportion to the
length of the intermediate volume of water.</p>

<p>In the farther prosecution of the enquiry, Davy
discovered a still more extraordinary series of facts.
In the first place, he found that the contact of the
saline solution with a metallic surface was not in the
least necessary for its decomposition. He introduced
purified water into two glass tubes, and connected
with them, by means of amianthus, a vessel
containing a solution of muriate of potash. In
this case, the saline matter was distant from each
of the wires at least two-thirds of an inch; and yet
alkaline matter soon appeared in one tube, and acid
matter in the other; and in sixteen hours moderately
strong solutions of potash and muriatic acid had been
formed.</p>

<p>The discovery of this fact became the key to that
of others. He very naturally proceeded to enquire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
into the progress of the transfer, and into the course
of the acid and alkaline elements; when, by the use
of litmus and turmeric, he arrived at the following
conclusion,&mdash;that acids and alkalies, during their
electrical transference, passed through water containing
vegetable colours without effecting in them
any change. From which we are led to the consideration
of the fourth division of the subject, viz.
"On the Passage of Acids, Alkalies, and other Substances,
through various attracting Chemical Menstrua,
by Electricity."</p>

<p>As soon as it was discovered that a power generated
by the Voltaic pile was capable of destroying
elective affinity in the vicinity of the metallic points,
it seemed reasonable to suppose, that the same power
might also destroy it, or at least suspend its operation,
throughout the whole of the circuit. The
truth of such a supposition was at once placed
beyond all doubt by the following very striking
experiment.</p>

<p>Three tubes, the first containing a solution of
<em>sulphate of potash</em>, the second a weak solution of
<em>ammonia</em>, and the third, <em>pure water</em>, each being
connected with the other in the usual manner by
amianthus, were arranged in relation to the pile, as
follow:&mdash;the <em>sulphate of potash</em> was placed in contact
with the negatively electrified point, the <em>pure water</em>
with the positively electrified point, while the solution
of <em>ammonia</em> was made the middle link of the
conducting chain; so that no sulphuric acid could
pass to the positive point in the distilled water, without
passing through the ammoniacal solution.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes after the electric current
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
had been completed, it was found, by means of litmus
paper, that acid was in the act of collecting
around the positive point; and in half an hour the
result was sufficiently distinct for accurate examination.</p>

<p>Other experiments were made with a solution of
lime, and with weak solutions of potash and soda,
and the results were analogous. Muriatic acid, from
muriate of soda, and nitric acid, from nitrate of
potash, were also transmitted through concentrated
alkaline menstrua, under similar circumstances,
and with like effects.</p>

<p>Davy also made several experiments on the transition
of alkaline and acid matter, through different
neutro-saline solutions, the results of which were
exactly such as theory would have anticipated.</p>

<p>In conducting, however, these experiments of
electrical transference, there would appear to be one
condition essential to their success, viz. that the
solution contained in the intermediate vessel should
not be capable of forming an insoluble compound
with the substance transmitted through it: thus,
for example, Davy found that <em>strontia</em> and <em>baryta</em>
passed, like the other alkaline substances, very readily
through muriatic and nitric acids; and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice
versâ</i>, that these acids passed with equal facility
through aqueous solutions of the earths in question;
but when it was attempted to pass <em>sulphuric</em> acid
through the same earthy solutions, or to pass the
earths through the sulphuric acid, that then the
results were of a very different character: the sulphuric
acid, in its passage through the barytic solution,
was arrested in its progress by the earthy body,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
and falling down as an insoluble compound with it,
was carried out of the sphere of the electrical action,
by which the power of transfer was destroyed. The
same phenomena occurred whenever he attempted
to pass muriatic acid through a solution of sulphate
of silver. We now come to the next division&mdash;viz.
"Some general Observations on these Phenomena,
and on the mode of Decomposition and Transition."</p>

<p>Davy considers that it will be a general expression
of the facts relating to the changes and transitions
by electricity, to say, that "hydrogen, the
alkaline substances, the metals, and certain oxides,
are attracted by negatively electrified, and repelled
by positively electrified metallic surfaces; and on
the contrary, that oxygen and acid substances are
attracted by positively electrified, and repelled by
negatively electrified metallic surfaces." And moreover,
that these "attractive and repulsive forces are
sufficiently energetic to destroy or suspend the usual
operation of elective affinity."</p>

<p>Amidst all these wonderful phenomena, that perhaps
which excites our greatest astonishment is the
fact of the transfer of ponderable matter to a considerable
distance, through intervening substances,
and in a form that escapes the cognizance of our
senses! Upon this question, Davy offers the following
remarks:&mdash;"It is," says he, "very natural to
suppose, that the repellent and attractive energies
are communicated from one particle to another particle
of the same kind, so as to establish a conducting
chain in the fluid; and that the locomotion takes
place in consequence: thus, in all the instances in
which I examined alkaline solutions through which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
acids had been transmitted, I always found acid in
them, as long as any acid matter remained at the
original source. In time, by the attractive power
of the positive surface, the decomposition and transfer
undoubtedly become complete; but this does
not affect the conclusion. In cases of the separation
of the constituents of water, and of solutions of neutral
salts forming the whole of the chain, there may
possibly be a succession of decompositions and recompositions
throughout the fluid."</p>

<p>We are next brought to a very important point
in the enquiry&mdash;viz. "The consideration of the
General Principles of the chemical changes produced
by Electricity."</p>

<p>The experiment of Mr. Bennett, already alluded
to, had shown that many bodies, when brought into
contact, and afterwards separated from each other,
exhibited signs of opposite states of electricity: but
it is to the investigations of M. Volta that we are
indebted for the clear developement of the fact; for
he has distinctly proved it in the case of copper and
zinc, and other metallic combinations, and he supposed
that it might also take place with regard to
metals and fluids.</p>

<p>In a series of experiments, made in the year 1801,
on the construction of electrical combinations, by
means of alternations of single metallic plates, and
different strata of fluids, as explained upon a former
occasion,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Davy had observed that, when acid and
alkaline solutions were employed as the elements of
these Voltaic combinations, the alkaline solutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
always received the electricity from, and the acid
always transmitted it to the metal. These principles
seem to bear an immediate relation to those general
phenomena of decomposition and transfer, which
have been the subject of the preceding details.</p>

<p>In the most simple case of electrical action, the
alkali which receives electricity from the metal
would necessarily, on being separated from it, appear
<em>positive</em>; whilst the acid, under similar circumstances,
would be <em>negative</em>; and these bodies having
respectively, with regard to the metal, that which
may be called a positive and a negative electrical
energy, in their repellent and attractive functions,
would seem to be governed by the common laws of
electrical attraction and repulsion; the body possessing
the positive energy being repelled by positively
electrified surfaces, and that possessing the
negative influence following the contrary order.</p>

<p>Davy made a number of experiments with the
view of elucidating this idea, and of extending its
application; and, in all cases, their results tended, in
a most remarkable manner, to confirm the analogy.</p>

<p>He proceeded, by means of very delicate instruments,
to ascertain the electrical states of single
insulated acid and alkaline solutions, after their contact
with metals; but the sources of errors were so
numerous, as to render the results far from being
satisfactory; but in experiments on dry and solid
bodies, the embarrassments arising from evaporation,
chemical action, &amp;c. did not occur. When perfectly
dry oxalic, succinic, benzoic, or boracic acid, either in
the form of powder or crystals, were touched upon
an extended surface with a plate of copper, insulated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
by a glass handle, the copper was found positive, the
acid negative. When again metallic plates were
made to touch dry lime, strontia, or magnesia, they
became negative: in these latter experiments the
effect was exceedingly satisfactory and distinct; a
single contact upon a large surface being sufficient
to communicate a considerable charge.</p>

<p>Numerous other trials were made, and the results
confirmed the principle; and moreover proved, as
might have been expected, that bodies possessing
electrical conditions with regard to one and the same
body, possessed them with regard to each other:
for instance, a dry piece of lime became positively
electrical by repeated contact with crystals of oxalic
acid.</p>

<p>These results led him to reason more fully upon
the "Relations between the Electrical energies of
bodies and their Chemical affinities."</p>

<p>As the chemical attraction subsisting between two
bodies seems to be destroyed by giving to one of
them an electrical condition opposite to that which
it naturally possesses; and since the substances that
combine chemically, as far as can be ascertained,
exhibit opposite states of electricity, the relations
between this energy and chemical affinity would
appear to be sufficiently evident to warrant the conclusion
at which Davy arrived, viz. that "the combinations
and decompositions by electricity were
referable to the law of electrical attractions and repulsions;"
from which he advanced to the still more
important step&mdash;"that chemical and electrical attractions
were produced by the same cause, acting in
one case on particles, in the other on masses."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
From these views, he is led to propose the electrical
powers, or the forces required to disunite the
elements of bodies, as a test or measure of the intensity
of chemical attraction. An accurate investigation
into this connexion, which may be called
the <em>Electro-dynamic</em> relations of bodies to their combining
masses or proportional numbers, would be the
first step towards fixing the science of Chemistry on
the permanent foundation of the Mathematics.</p>

<p>If, then, the power of electrical attraction and
repulsion be identified with chemical affinity, or
rather, if both be dependent upon the same cause, it
will follow that two bodies which are naturally in
opposite electrical states, may have these states sufficiently
exalted to give them an attractive power
superior to the cohesive force opposed to their
union; when a combination will take place which
will be more or less energetic, as the opposed forces
are more or less equally balanced. Again, when
two bodies, repellent of each other, act upon a third
with different degrees of the same electrical energy,
the combination will be determined by the degree;
or, if bodies having different degrees of the same
electrical energy with respect to a third, have likewise
different energies with respect to each other,
there may be such a balance of attracting and repelling
forces as to produce a triple compound; and by
the extension of this reasoning, complicated chemical
union may be easily explained.</p>

<p>Whenever bodies brought by artificial means into
a high state of opposite electricities are made to
restore the equilibrium, heat and light are the common
consequences. It is perhaps an additional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
circumstance in favour of the theory to state, that
heat and light are likewise the results of all intense
chemical action. And as in certain forms of the
Voltaic battery, where large quantities of electricity
of low intensity act, heat without light is produced;
so in slow chemical combinations there is an increase
of temperature without any luminous appearance.</p>

<p>The effect of heat in producing combination may
be easily explained according to these ideas; it not
only gives more freedom of motion to the particles,
but in a number of cases it seems to exalt the electrical
energies of bodies:&mdash;glass, the tourmaline,
sulphur, and some others, afford familiar instances
of this latter species of energy.</p>

<p>In general, when the different energies are strong
and in perfect equilibrium, the combination ought
to be quick, the heat and light intense, and the new
compound in a neutral state. This would seem to
be the case in the combination of oxygen and hydrogen,
which form water, a body apparently neutral
in electrical energy to most others; and also in the
circumstances of the union of the strong alkalies
and acids. But where one energy is feeble, and the
other strong, all the effects must be less vivid; and
the compound, instead of being neutral, ought to
exhibit the excess of the stronger energy.</p>

<p>The grand principle thus developed may enable
us to obtain new and useful indications of the composition
of bodies, by ascertaining the character of
their electrical energies; and we now find, in most
modern works of Chemistry, that bodies are arranged
according to their natural electrical relations; and
are said to be <span class="smcap">Electro-positive</span>, or <span class="smcap">Electro-negative</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
according to their polarities. The advantage
of such an arrangement must be freely
acknowledged, for it has been the means of establishing
analogies<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> of the utmost importance in chemistry,
of which I shall adduce some striking examples
in a subsequent part of the present work,
when I shall endeavour to offer a general view of
the revolution which chemical science has undergone
during the investigations of Davy, and contemporary
philosophers.</p>

<p>After some further enquiries into the theory of
the Voltaic pile,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> to which an allusion has been
already made, the author offers additional reasons
for supposing the decomposition of the chemical
menstrua essential to the continued electro-motion
of the pile; and if the fluid medium could be a
substance incapable of decomposition, there is every
reason to believe the equilibrium would be restored,
and the motion of the Electricity cease. Having
shown the effects of <em>induction</em>, in increasing the
electricity of the opposite plates, he arrives at the
important conclusion, that in a Voltaic arrangement
the <em>intensity of the Electricity increases with the
number, but the quantity with the size of the plates</em>.
A theory which was subsequently confirmed by the
experiments of Mr. Children.</p>

<p>The paper concludes with "some general illustrations
and applications of the foregoing facts and
principles," and which the author thinks will readily
suggest themselves to the philosophical enquirer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
They offer, for instance, very easy methods of separating
acid and alkaline matter, where they exist
in combination in mineral substances; and, in like
manner, they suggest the application of electrical
powers for effecting the decomposition of animal
and vegetable bodies.</p>

<p>On exposing a piece of muscular fibre to the
action of the battery, he found that potash, soda,
ammonia, lime, and oxide of iron, were evolved on
the negative side, and the three mineral, together
with the phosphoric, acids, were given out on the
positive side.</p>

<p>A laurel leaf, similarly treated, yielded to the negative
vessel resin, alkali, and lime; while in the positive
one there collected a clear fluid, which had the
smell of peach-blossoms, and which, when neutralized
by potash, gave a blue-green precipitate to a
solution of sulphate of iron; so that it must have
contained <em>Prussic Acid</em>.</p>

<p>A small plant of mint, in a state of healthy vegetation,
on being made the medium of connection in
the battery, yielded potash and lime to the water
negatively electrified, and acid to that positively
electrified. The plant recovered after the process;
but a similar one, that had been electrified during a
longer period, faded and died.</p>

<p>These facts would seem to show, that the electrical
powers of decomposition even act upon vegetable
matter in its living condition; and phenomena
are not wanting to show that they operate also on
the system of living animals. When the fingers,
after having been carefully washed with pure water,
are brought in contact with this fluid in the positive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
part of the circuit, acid matter is rapidly developed,
having the character of a mixture of muriatic, phosphoric,
and sulphuric acids; and if a similar trial be
made in the negative part, fixed alkaline matter is
as quickly developed.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Davy thinks that the acid and alkaline taste produced
upon the tongue during galvanic experiments,
depends upon the decomposition of the saline
matter contained in the living animal substance,
and perhaps in the saliva; and he farther observes
that, as acid and alkaline substances are thus evidently
capable of being separated from their combinations
in living systems by electrical powers, there
is reason to believe that, by converse methods, they
might also be introduced into the animal economy,
or made to pass through the animal organs; and the
same thing may be supposed of metallic oxides; and
that these ideas ought to lead to some new investigations
in Medicine and Physiology.</p>

<p>He thinks it by no means improbable, that the
electrical decomposition of the neutral salts, in different
cases, may admit of economical applications;
and that well-burnt charcoal and plumbago, or charcoal
and iron, might be made the exciting powers
for such a purpose. Such an arrangement, if erected
upon a scale sufficiently extensive, with the medium
of a neutro-saline solution, would, in his opinion,
produce large quantities of acids and alkalies
with very little trouble or expense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Alterations in chemical equilibrium are constantly
taking place in Nature, and he thinks it probable
that the electric influence, in its faculties of decomposition
and transference, may considerably interfere
with the chemical changes occurring in different
parts of our system.</p>

<p>The electrical appearances which precede earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions, and which have been
described by the greater number of the observers of
these awful events, admit also of easy explanation
on the principles that have been stated.</p>

<p>Besides the cases of sudden and violent change,
he considers there must be constant and tranquil
alterations, of which electricity, produced in the interior
strata of the globe, is the active cause: thus,
where <em>pyritous</em> strata and strata of <em>coal-blende</em> occur,&mdash;where
the pure metals or the sulphurets are found
in contact with each other, or with any conducting
substances,&mdash;and where different strata contain different
saline menstrua, he thinks electricity must be
continually manifested; and it is probable that many
mineral formations have been materially influenced,
or even occasioned, by its agencies.</p>

<p>In an experiment which he performed of electrifying
a mixed solution of the muriates of iron, copper,
tin, and cobalt, contained in a positive vessel,
all the four oxides passed along the connecting
asbestus into a positive vessel filled with distilled
water, while a yellow metallic crust formed on the
wire, and the oxides arranged themselves in a mixed
state around the base of it.</p>

<p>In another experiment, in which carbonate of
copper was diffused through water in a state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
minute division, and a negative wire was placed in
a small perforated cube of zeolite in the water, green
crystals collected round the cube; the particles not
being capable of penetrating it.</p>

<p>By a multiplication of such instances, Davy remarks,
that the electrical power of transference may
be easily conceived to apply to the explanation of
some of the principal and most mysterious facts in
geology;<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and by imagining a scale of feeble powers,
it would be easy to account for the association of the
insoluble metallic and earthy compounds containing
acids.</p>

<p>"Natural electricity," observes our philosopher,
"has hitherto been little investigated, except in the
case of its evident and powerful concentration in
the atmosphere. Its slow and silent operations in
every part of the surface will probably be found
more immediately and importantly connected with
the order and economy of nature; and investigations
on this subject can hardly fail to enlighten our
philosophical systems of the earth, and may possibly
place new powers within our reach."</p>

<p>Thus concludes one of the most masterly and
powerful productions of scientific genius. I may
perhaps have been considered prolix in recording
the progressive researches by which he arrived at
his results; but let it be remembered, that the great
fame of Davy, as an experimental philosopher, rests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
upon this single memoir; and though the secondary
results to be hereafter considered, may be more
dazzling to ordinary minds, yet in the judgment
of every scientific observer, they must appear far
less glorious than the discovery of the primitive
laws. Let me ask whether Sir Isaac Newton does
not deserve greater fame for his invention of fluxions,
than for the calculations performed by the
application of them? I do not hesitate in comparing
these great philosophers, since each has enlightened
us by discoveries alike effected by means
invented by himself. Not only did both unlock
the caskets of Nature, but they had the superior
merit of planning and constructing the key.</p>

<p>I challenge those, who have carefully followed
me through the details of the preceding memoir, to
show a single instance in which accident, so mainly
contributory to former discoveries in electricity, had
any share in conducting its author to truth. Step
by step did he, with philosophic caution and unwearied
perseverance, unfold all the particular phenomena
and details of his subject; his genius then
took flight, and with an eagle's eye caught the plan
of the whole.&mdash;A new science has been thus created;
and so important and extensive are its applications,
so boundless and sublime its views, that we
may fairly anticipate the fulfilment of those prophetic
words of Dr. Priestley, who, in the preface to
his History of Electricity,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> exclaims&mdash;"Electricity
seems to be giving us an inlet into the internal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
structure of bodies, on which all their sensible properties
depend. By pursuing this new light, therefore,
the bounds of natural science may possibly be
extended beyond what we can now form any idea
of. New worlds may open to our view, and the
glory of the great Sir Isaac Newton himself, and all
his contemporaries, be eclipsed by a new set of philosophers,
in quite a new field of speculation. Could
that great man revisit the earth, and view the experiments
of the present race of electricians, he
would be no less amazed than Roger Bacon, or
Sir Francis, would have been at his." In our turn
we may ask, what would be the astonishment&mdash;what
the delight of Dr. Priestley, could he now
witness the successful results of Voltaic research?&mdash;and
what would he say of that mighty genius who
has demonstrated the relations of electrical energy
to the general laws of chemical action?<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> It was
his good fortune to have witnessed the discovery
which identified electricity with the lightning of
the thunder cloud: what would he have said of
that which identified it with the magnetism of the
earth! Of this at least we may be certain, that he
would have expunged from his history the passage
in which he observes&mdash;"Electrical discoveries have
been made so much by accident, that it is more the
powers of nature, than of human genius, that excite
our wonders with respect to them."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="hanging">The unfair rivalry of Philosophers.&mdash;Bonaparte the Patron of Science.&mdash;He
liberates Dolomieu.&mdash;He founds a Prize for the
encouragement of Electric researches.&mdash;His letter to the Minister
of the Interior.&mdash;Proceedings of the Institute.&mdash;The Prize is
conferred on Davy.&mdash;The Bakerian Lecture of 1807.&mdash;The

contains Oxygen.&mdash;Davy's severe Illness.&mdash;He recovers
and resumes his labours.&mdash;His Fishing Costume.&mdash;He decomposes
the Earths.&mdash;Important views to which the discovery
has led.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that there has too frequently
existed amongst philosophers a strange and ungenerous
disposition to undervalue the labours of their
contemporaries. If a discovery be made, its truth
and importance are first questioned; and should
these be established, then its originality becomes
a subject of dispute.</p>

<p>Truth, although she may have been rarely held
fast, has been frequently touched<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> in the dark: it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
is not extraordinary, therefore, that evidence may
be often strained from the writings of philosophers
in support of prior claims to late discoveries;
but upon a candid review, these loose statements,
or obscure hints, will generally be found wholly
destitute of the pretensions which an unfair spirit
of rivalry has too often laboured to support. Many
of such hints, indeed, so far from advancing the
progress of truth, had never even attracted notice,
until after the discoveries to which they have been
supposed to relate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Although the importance of Davy's Electro-chemical
discoveries could not for a moment be doubted;
their claims to originality, it would seem, were
not admitted without some question. The works
of Ritter and Winterl, amongst many others, were
quoted to show that these philosophers had imagined
or anticipated the relation between electrical powers
and chemical affinities; but Davy very fairly observes,
in a paper read before the Royal Society in
1826, that in the obscurity of the language and
metaphysics of both those gentlemen, it is difficult</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
to say what may not be found. In the ingenious
though wild views of Ritter, there are hints which
may more readily be considered as applying to <em>Electro-magnetism</em>
than to <em>Electro-chemistry</em>; while
Winterl's <em>Miraculous Andronia</em> might, with as
much propriety, be considered as a type of all the
chemical substances that have been since discovered,
as his view of the antagonist powers (the acid and
base) be regarded as an anticipation of the <em>Electro-chemical</em>
theory.</p>

<p>It would be worse than useless to speak of other
works, which refer the origin of Electro-chemistry
to Germany, Sweden, and France, rather than to
Italy and England; and which attribute some of
the views first developed by Davy, to philosophers
who have not, nor ever could have made any claim
of the kind, since their experiments were actually
not published until many years after 1806, the date
of the Bakerian Lecture.</p>

<p>With regard to the judgment of posterity upon
these points, but little apprehension can be entertained.
I well remember, in a conversation with
Davy, he observed, that "a philosopher might generally
discover how his labours would be appreciated
in after ages, from the opinion entertained of them
by contemporary foreigners, who, being unbiassed
by circumstances of personality, will reduce every
object to its just proportions and value."</p>

<p>If we acknowledge the truth of such a standard,
and submit the posthumous fame of Davy to its
measure, where is the philosopher, in our times,
whose name is destined to attain a higher eminence
in the history of Science? Let the reader only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
recall to his recollection the bitter animosity which
France and England mutually entertained towards
each other in the year 1807, and he will be able to
form some idea of the astounding impression which
the Bakerian Lecture must have produced on the
Savans of Paris, when, in despite of national prejudice
and national vanity, it was crowned by the
Institute of France with the prize of the First Consul!
Thus did the Voltaic battery, in the hands of
the English chemist, achieve what all the artillery
of Britain could never have produced&mdash;<span class="smcap">a spontaneous
and willing homage to British superiority!</span>&mdash;But
let not this observation convey the
slightest idea of disrespect, or be supposed to encourage
any feeling to the disparagement of the
chemists of France; on the contrary, it is even a
question not readily answered, to which party the
triumph fairly belongs,&mdash;to him who won the laurel
crown, or to those who so nobly placed it on his
brow? They have set an example to future ages,
which may as materially advance the progress of
science, as the researches which called it forth:&mdash;they
have shown, to adopt the language of an eloquent
writer, that "the Commonwealth of Science
is of no party, and of no nation; that it is a pure
Republic, and always at peace. Its shades are disturbed
neither by domestic malice nor foreign levy;
they resound not with the cries of faction or of public
animosity. Falsehood is the only enemy their
inhabitants denounce; Truth, and her minister Reason,
the only leaders they follow."</p>

<p>I shall avail myself of this opportunity to introduce
the Report drawn up by M. Biot, and made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
in the name of a Commission appointed by the Institute
to accomplish the intention of Bonaparte,
who, when First Consul, founded prizes for important
discoveries in Electricity or Galvanism.</p>

<p>It is an opinion very generally received, that despotism
is hostile to the progress of Philosophy&mdash;that
the suspicion natural to tyranny, and the fear that
light should expose its deformity, have, under such
circumstances, inspired a dread of any thing approaching
to freedom of enquiry. The conduct of
Napoleon, not only during his Consulate, but even
after he had assumed the Purple, is in direct opposition
to such an opinion. Now that the excitements of
national hostility have subsided, and the asperity of
our feelings towards that extraordinary man has been
softened by time and prosperity, we are enabled to
discern the bright and sunny spots in his character.</p>

<p>Not to mention the immense plans which his
genius suggested for the internal improvement of
France, the annals of the Institute would furnish
innumerable proofs of the zeal with which he encouraged
Science, and promoted its interests.</p>

<p>His liberation of Dolomieu from the dungeons
of Tarentum was an act not only remarkable for the
considerate regard it displayed for Science, but for
the spirit and eagerness with which it was effected.
The French Government had repeatedly made the
most urgent demands for the liberty of one who
had reflected so much credit on his country;&mdash;the
Danes had also directed the interference of their
Minister, and the King of Spain had added his
solicitations in vain:&mdash;no sooner, however, had the
astonishing campaign which terminated by the victory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
of Marengo, completely established the French
Republic, than Bonaparte, in making peace with
Naples, stipulated for the immediate deliverance of
Dolomieu, as the first article of the treaty.</p>

<p>The following letter from Bonaparte, addressed
to the Minister of the Interior, and by him transmitted
to the Institute, expresses the intentions of
the First Consul, in founding prizes for important
discoveries in Electricity or Galvanism.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>"I intend, Citizen Minister, to found a prize,
consisting of a Medal of three thousand francs,
(about one hundred and twenty pounds sterling,)
for the best experiment which shall be made in the
course of each year, on the Galvanic fluid.</p>

<p>"For this purpose, the Memoirs containing the
details of the said experiments shall be sent before
the First of <em>Fructidor</em>, to the Class of the Mathematical
and Physical Sciences, which in the complimentary
days shall adjudge the prize to the author
of that experiment which has been most useful to
the progress of Science.</p>

<p>"I also desire to give, by the way of encouragement,
the sum of sixty thousand francs to the person
who, by his experiments and discoveries, shall, according
to the opinion of the Class, advance the
knowledge of Electricity and Galvanism as much
as Franklin and Volta did.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
"Foreigners of all nations are admitted to the

<p>"I beg you will make known these dispositions
to the President of the First Class of the National
Institute, that it may give to these ideas such developement
as may appear proper; my particular
object being to encourage philosophers, and to direct
their attention to this part of philosophy, which, in
my opinion, may lead to great discoveries.</p>

<p class="signature">"(Signed)  <span class="smcap j2">Bonaparte</span>."</p>

<p>Upon the presentation of this letter, a Committee
was appointed to consider the means for accomplishing
the intentions of the First Consul; and after
expatiating upon the extensive agencies of Electricity,
their Report concludes in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>"To fulfill the intention of the First Consul, and
to give to the competition all the solemnity which
the importance of the object, the nature of the Prize,

Sciences of the National Institute opens the general
competition required by the First Consul.</p>

<p>"All the learned of Europe, and the Members
and Associates of the Institute, are admitted to the
competition.</p>

<p>"The Class does not require that the Memoirs
should be immediately addressed to it. Every year
it will crown the author of the best experiments
which shall come to its knowledge, and which shall
have advanced the progress of the science.</p>

<p>"The present report, containing the letter of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
First Consul, shall be printed, and serve as a programme.</p>

</div>

<p>It was not until twelve months after the publication
of his first Bakerian Lecture, that Davy received
the intelligence that the prize of three thousand
francs had been awarded him by the Institute of
France, for his discoveries announced in the Philosophical
Transactions for the year 1807.</p>

<p>Mr. Poole, in a late communication, informs me
that he was in London soon after the letter communicating
this gratifying intelligence had been
received from France; and that Davy, upon showing
it to him, observed, "Some people say I ought not
to accept this prize; and there have been foolish
paragraphs in the papers to that effect; but if the
two countries or governments are at war, the men
of science are not. That would, indeed, be a civil
war of the worst description: we should rather,
through the instrumentality of men of science,
soften the asperities of national hostility."</p>

<p>After Davy had been elected Secretary to the
Royal Society, he appears to have been confined to
town during the autumn of 1807, when he wrote
the following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">      August 28th, 1807.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>I am obliged to be in the neighbourhood of town
during the greater part of the summer, for the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
of correcting the press for the Philosophical
Transactions.</p>

<p>I made a rapid journey into Cornwall for the sake
of seeing my family; and it was not in my power,
had I received your letter at Lyme, to have accepted
your kind invitation.</p>

<p>If C&mdash;&mdash; is still with you, will you be kind enough
to say to him, that I wrote nearly a week ago two
letters about lectures, and not knowing where he
was, I addressed them to him at different places?
I wish very much he would seriously determine on
this point. The Managers of the Royal Institution
are very anxious to engage him; and I think he
might be of material service to the public, and of
benefit to his own mind, to say nothing of the benefit
his purse might also receive. In the present
condition of society, his opinions in matters of taste,
literature, and metaphysics, must have a healthy
influence; and unless he soon become an actual
member of the living world, he must expect to
be hereafter brought to judgment 'for hiding his
light.'</p>

<p>The times seem to me to be less dangerous, as to
the immediate state of this country, than they were
four years ago. The extension of the French Empire
has weakened the disposable force of France.
Bonaparte seems to have abandoned the idea of invasion;
and if our Government is active, we have
little to dread from a maritime war, at least for some
time. Sooner or later, our Colonial Empire must
fall in due time, when it has answered its ends.</p>

<p>The wealth of our island must be diminished, but
the strength of mind of the people cannot easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
pass away; and our literature, our science, our arts,
and the dignity of our nature, depend little upon
our external relations. When we had fewer colonies
than Genoa, we had Bacons and Shakspeares.</p>

<p>The wealth and prosperity of the country are
only the <em>comeliness</em> of the body&mdash;the fulness of the
flesh and fat;&mdash;but the spirit is independent of
them; it requires only muscle, bone, and nerve, for
the true exercise of its functions. We cannot lose
our liberty, because we cannot cease to <em>think</em>; and
ten millions of people are not easily annihilated.</p>

<p>I am, my dear Poole, very truly yours,</p>

<p class="signature smcap">H. Davy.</p>
</div>

<p>While the Electro-chemical laws, developed in
the last chapter, are fresh in the recollection of the
reader, I shall proceed to the consideration of his
second Bakerian Lecture, which was read in November
1807; and in which he announces the discovery
of the metallic bases of the fixed alkalies,&mdash;a discovery
immediately arising from the application of
Voltaic electricity, directed in accordance with those
laws;&mdash;thus having, as we have seen in the first instance,
ascended from particular phenomena to general
principles, he now descends from those principles
to the discovery of new phenomena: a method of
investigation by which he may be said to have
applied to his inductions the severest tests of truth,
and to have produced a chain of evidence without
having a single link deficient.</p>

<p>Since the account given by Newton of his first
discoveries in Optics, it may be questioned whether
so happy and successful an instance of philosophical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
induction has ever been afforded as that by which
Davy discovered the composition of the fixed alkalies.
Had it been true, as was most unjustly insinuated
at the time, that the discovery was accidentally
effected by the high power of the apparatus
placed at his disposal, his claims to our admiration
would have assumed a very different character: in
such a case, he might be said to have forced open
the sanctuary of Nature by direct violence, instead
of having discovered and touched the secret spring
by which its portals were unclosed. The justice of
these remarks will best appear in the examination
of his memoir: the highest eulogy that can be conferred
on its author will be a faithful and plain
history of its contents.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, in his preceding lecture
of 1806, he had described a number of decompositions
and chemical changes produced in substances
of known composition, by the powers of
electricity, and that in all such cases there invariably
subsisted an attraction between oxygen and the
<em>positive</em> pole, and between inflammable matter and
the <em>negative</em> pole of the pile: thus, in the decomposition
of water, its oxygen was transferred to the
former, and its hydrogen to the latter. Furnished
with such data, Davy proceeded to submit a fixed
alkali to the most intense action of the Voltaic apparatus,
well convinced that, should the electrical
energy be adequate to effect its decomposition, the
elements would be transferred, according to this
general law, to their respective poles.</p>

<p>His first attempts were made on solutions of the
alkalies; but, notwithstanding the intensity of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
electric action, the water alone underwent decomposition,
and oxygen and hydrogen were disengaged
with the production of much heat, and violent effervescence.
The presence of water thus appearing to
prevent the desired decomposition, potash, in a state
of igneous fusion, was in various ways submitted to
experiment; when it was evident that combustible
matter of some kind, burning with a vivid light,
was given off at the negative wire. After numerous
trials, during the progress of which the difficulties
which successively arose were as immediately
combated by ingenious manipulation, a small piece
of potash sufficiently moistened, by a short exposure
to the air, to give its surface a conducting power,
was placed on an insulated disc of platina, connected
with the negative side of the battery in a state of
intense activity, and a platina wire communicating
with the positive side, was at the same instant
brought into contact within the upper surface of
the alkali.&mdash;Mark what followed!&mdash;A series of
phenomena, each of which the reader will readily
understand as it is announced,&mdash;for it will be in
strict accordance with the laws which Davy had
previously established:&mdash;the potash began to fuse at
both its points of electrization: a violent effervescence
commenced at the upper, or positive surface;
while at the lower, or negative one, instead of any
liberation of elastic matter, which would probably
have happened had hydrogen been an element of
the alkaline body, small globules, resembling quicksilver,
appeared, some of which were no sooner
formed than they burnt with explosion and bright
flame.&mdash;What must have been the sensations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Davy at this moment!&mdash;He had decomposed potash,
and obtained its base in a metallic form.</p>

<p>The gaseous matter developed, during the experiment,
at the positive pole of the apparatus, he
very shortly identified as oxygen. To collect, however,
the metallic matter, in a quantity sufficient
for a satisfactory examination, was by no means so
easy; for, like the <em>Alkahest</em> imagined by the Alchemist,
it acted more or less upon every body to
which it was exposed; and such was its attraction
for oxygen, that it speedily reverted to the state of
alkali by recombining with it.</p>

<p>After various trials, however, it was found that
recently distilled naphtha presented a medium in
which it might be preserved and examined, since
a thin transparent film of this fluid, while it defended
the metal from the action of the atmosphere,
did not oppose any obstacle to the investigation of
its physical properties.</p>

<p>Thus provided, he proceeded to enquire into the
nature of the new and singular body, to which he
afterwards gave the name of <span class="smcap">Potassium</span>, and which
may be described as follows.</p>

<p>Its external character is that of a white metal,
instantly tarnishing by exposure to air; at the temperature
of 70° Fah. it exists in small globules,
which possess the metallic lustre, opacity, and general
appearance of quicksilver; so that when a
globule of the latter is placed near one of the
former, the eye cannot discover any difference between
them: at this temperature, however, the
metal is not perfectly fluid; but when gradually
heated, it becomes more so,&mdash;and at 150°, its fluidity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
is so perfect that several globules may be easily
made to run into one. By reducing its temperature,
it becomes, at 50°, a soft and malleable solid,
which has the lustre of polished silver, and is soft
enough to be moulded like wax. At about the
freezing point of water it becomes hard and brittle,
and exhibits, when broken, a crystallized structure
of perfect whiteness, and of high metallic splendour.
It is also a perfect conductor both of electricity and
heat. Thus far, then, it fulfills every condition of a
metal; but an anomaly of a most startling description
has now to be mentioned&mdash;the absence of a
quality which has been as invariably associated with
the idea of a metal, as that of lustre, viz. great specific
gravity. Whence a question has arisen, whether, after
all, the alkaline base can with propriety be classed
under that denomination? Instead of possessing
that ponderosity which we should have expected in
a body otherwise metallic, it is so light as not only to
swim upon the surface of water, but even upon that
of naphtha, by far the lightest liquid in nature.
Davy, however, very justly argues, that low specific
gravity does not offer a sufficient reason for
degrading this body from the rank of a metal; for
amongst those which constitute the class, there are
remarkable differences with respect to this quality;
that platina is nearly four times as heavy as tellurium.
In the philosophical division of bodies
into classes, the analogy between the greater number
of properties must always be the foundation of
arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
So inseparable however, by long association, are
the ideas of ponderosity and metallic splendour,
that the evidence even of the senses may fail in
disuniting them.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> This is well illustrated by the
following amusing anecdote. Shortly after the discovery
of potassium, Dr. George Pearson happened
to enter the laboratory in the Royal Institution, and
upon being shown the new substance, and interrogated
as to its nature, he, without the least hesitation,
on seeing its lustre, exclaimed, "Why, it is
metallic, to be sure," and then, balancing it on his
finger, he added, in the same tone of confidence,
"<em>Bless me, how heavy it is!</em>"</p>

<p>When thrown upon water, potassium instantly
decomposes that fluid, and an explosion is produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
with a vehement flame: an experiment which is
rendered more striking if, for water, ice be substituted;
in this latter case, it instantly bums with
a bright rose-coloured flame, and a deep hole is
made in the ice, which will afterwards be found
to contain a solution of potash.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to state, that these phenomena
depend upon the very powerful affinity which
the metal possesses for oxygen, enabling it even to
separate it from its most subtle combinations.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>One of the neatest modes of showing the production
of alkali, in the decomposition of water by the
basis of potash, consists in dropping a globule of
potassium upon moistened paper tinged with turmeric.
At the moment that it comes into contact
with the water, it burns and moves rapidly upon
the paper, as if in search of moisture, leaving behind
it a deep reddish-brown trace of its progress, and
acting upon the test paper precisely as dry caustic
potash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
From these observations, the reader will immediately
perceive, that the decomposition of the fixed
alkalies has placed in the hands of the experimentalist
a new instrument of research, scarcely less
energetic, or of less universal application, than the
power from which the discovery emanated. Davy
observes upon this point, that "it will undoubtedly
prove a powerful agent for analysis, and having an
affinity for oxygen, stronger than any other known
substance, it may possibly supersede the application
of electricity to some of the undecompounded bodies."
So strong indeed is its affinity for oxygen,
that it discovers and decomposes the small quantities
of water contained in alcohol and ether; and in the
latter case, this decomposition is connected with an
instructive result. Potash is insoluble in that fluid:
when therefore its base is thrown into it, oxygen is
furnished, hydrogen gas disengaged, and the alkali,
as it is regenerated, renders the ether white and
turbid.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most beautiful illustration of its
deoxidizing power is afforded by its action on carbonic
acid gas, or fixed air: when heated in contact
with that gas, it catches fire, and by uniting with
its oxygen, becomes potash, while the liberated
carbon is deposited in the form of charcoal.</p>

<p>As I have already exceeded the limits originally
prescribed to myself, I shall not enter into the history
of Davy's experiments on the other fixed alkali,
soda, farther than to state that, when it was submitted
to Voltaic action, a bright metal was obtained,
similar in its general characters to potassium, but
possessing sufficiently distinctive peculiarities as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
volatility, fusibility, oxidability, &amp;c. To this body
Davy assigned the name of <span class="smcap">Sodium</span>.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>In support of the metallic characters of these
alkaline bases, it may be necessary to state that they
combine with each other, and form alloys; the properties
and habitudes of which are very interesting,
and are fully described by their discoverer.</p>

<p>No sooner had these results been made known to
the scientific world, than a question arose, both in
this country and abroad, as to the real nature of the
bodies which had been thus obtained from the fixed
alkalies, and which presented an aspect so obviously
metallic. At first, it was conjectured by a few, that
they might be compounds of the alkali with the
platina used in the experiments; but this was at
once disproved by Davy having obtained the same
results when pieces of copper, silver, gold, plumbago,
or even charcoal, had been employed for completing
the Voltaic circuit.</p>

<p>The effect which this and his subsequent discoveries
produced, in revolutionizing the theory of
Chemistry, will form an interesting subject for discussion
in a future part of the present work: I
shall therefore only remark in passing, that the fact
of oxygen, the acknowledged principle of acidity,
existing in combination with a metallic base, and
imparting to it the properties of an alkali, was no
sooner announced, than its truth was strenuously
denied. It was an attack upon opinions sanctioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
by the general suffrage of the scientific world;&mdash;it
was, in fact, storming the very citadel of their philosophy:
no wonder, then, that the agitator should
have been assailed with a full cry for his revolutionary
plans.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> M. Curadau read a paper before the
French Institute, in which he endeavoured to prove,
<em>first</em>, that the conversion of the alkalies into metals
was not a deoxidation of those bodies, but a combination
of them with new elements;&mdash;<em>secondly</em>, that
the affinity of the alkaline metals for oxygen was
merely a chemical illusion, occasioned by some body
the presence of which had not been suspected;&mdash;<em>thirdly</em>,
that carbon was one of the elements of the
alkaline metals, since it could be separated from them
at pleasure, or converted into carbonic acid;&mdash;and
<em>fourthly</em>, that if the specific gravities of the new
substances were less than that of water, it was because
hydrogen was associated with carbon in the
combination.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to state, that the presence
of carbon was readily traced to sources of impurity.
The hypothesis which assumed the existence of hydrogen
as an element, was not so easily refuted. It
was espoused by MM. Gay Lussac, Thénard, and
Ritter, on the Continent, and by Mr. Dalton in
England. The former derived their inference from
the action of potassium upon ammonia, by which</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
they obtained a fusible substance that yielded by
heat more hydrogen than the ammonia contained;
the latter contended that potassium and sodium are
proved to be <em>hydrurets</em>, by the very process employed
for their production; for, since common potash
is a <em>hydrat</em>, and oxygen is produced at one surface,
and potassium at the other, by Voltaic action, he
conceived that the former arose from the decomposition
of water, and that the hydrogen must therefore
unite with the potash to form potassium. It is
a curious fact, that Berthollet, in the very sentence
in which he insisted upon the excessive quantity of
hydrogen disengaged in his experiment, as a proof
that potassium must be a <em>hydruret</em>, should have
stated that the addition of water to the residuum
was necessary for obtaining his result. How could
it have happened that he overlooked so obvious a
source of hydrogen? Mr. Dalton, as well as Ritter,
considered the low specific gravity as favouring the
idea of their containing hydrogen; but Davy observes
that they are less volatile than antimony,
arsenic, and tellurium, and much less so than mercury.
Besides, sodium absorbs much more oxygen
than potassium, and, on the hypothesis of hydrogenation,
must therefore contain more hydrogen; and
yet though soda is said to be lighter than potash,
in the proportion of thirteen to seventeen nearly,
sodium is heavier than potassium, in the proportion
of nine to seven at least. On the theory
of Davy, this circumstance is what ought to have
been expected. Potassium has a much stronger
affinity for oxygen than sodium, and must condense
it much more; and the resulting higher specific
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
gravity of the combination is a necessary consequence.
In this manner did Davy entangle his opponents
in their own arguments, and establish, in
the most triumphant manner, the truths of his original
views.</p>

<p>Thus then was a discovery effected, and at once
rendered complete, which all the chemists in Europe
had vainly attempted to accomplish. The alkalies
had been tortured by every variety of experiment
which ingenuity could suggest, or perseverance perform,
but all in vain; nor was the pursuit abandoned
until indefatigable effort had wrecked the
patience and exhausted every resource of the experimentalist.
Such was the disheartening, and almost
forlorn condition of the philosopher when
Davy entered the field:&mdash;he created new instruments,
new powers, and fresh resources; and Nature,
thus interrogated on a different plan, at once
revealed her long cherished secret.</p>

<p>In his Bakerian Lecture, Davy observes, that "a
historical detail of the progress of the investigation
of all the difficulties that occurred, and of the manner
in which they were overcome, and of all the
manipulations employed, would far exceed the limits
assigned to a Lecture." But to the chemist, every
circumstance, however minute, connected with a
subject of such commanding importance, is pregnant
with interest; I therefore considered it my duty
to search into the archives of the Institution, in the
hope that I should discover some memoranda which
might supply additional information. In examining
the Laboratory Register, I have so far succeeded
as to obtain some rough and imperfect notes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
which will, to a certain degree, assist us in analysing
the intellectual operations by which his mind ultimately
arrived at the grand conclusion.</p>

<p>It appears from this register that Davy commenced
his enquiries into the composition of potash
on the 16th, and obtained his great result on the
19th of October 1807.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> His first experiments, however,
evidently did not suggest the truth: he does
not appear to have suspected the nature of the alkaline
base until his last experiment, when the truth
flashed upon him in the full blaze of discovery.
His first note, dated the 16th, leads us to infer that
he acted on a solid piece of potash, under the surface
of alcohol, and several other liquids in which
the alkali was not soluble; and that he obtained
gaseous matter, which he called at the moment
'<em>Alkaligen Gas</em>,' and which he appears to have examined
most closely, without arriving at any conclusion
as to its nature. On the following day, he,
for the first time, would seem to have developed
potassium by electric action on potash under oil
of turpentine, for the note records the fact of "<em>the</em>
globules giving out gas by water, which gas <em>burnt
in contact with air</em>;" and then follows a query&mdash;"Does
<em>it</em>" (the matter of the globules) "not form
gaseous compounds with ether, alcohol, and the oils?"
Here, then, he evidently imagined, that the matter
of the globules, which he had never obtained
from potash, except when acted upon under oil of
turpentine, had formed gaseous compounds with
the ether, alcohol, and oils in his previous experiments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
and given origin to that which he had
termed '<em>Alkaligen Gas</em>.'</p>

<p>He then leaves the consideration of this gas, and
attacks the unknown globules, which probably did
not present any metallic appearance under the circumstances
in which he saw them, for they must
have been as minute as grains of sand. I rather
think that he commenced his examination by introducing
a globule of mercury, and uniting it with a
globule of the unknown substance, for his note says,
"Action of the substance on Mercury,&mdash;forms with
it a solid amalgam, which soon loses its <em>Alkaligen</em>
in the air." And from the note which succeeds,
he evidently considered this <em>Alkaligen</em> (potassium)
volatile, as he says "it soon flies off on exposure to
the air."</p>

<p>October 19.&mdash;It is probable that, in consequence
of the property which the unknown substance displayed
of amalgamating with mercury, he devised
his experiment of the 19th. He took a small glass
tube, about the size and shape of a thimble, into
which he fused a platinum wire, and passed it
through the closed end. He then put a piece of
pure potash into this tube, and fused it into a mass
about the wire, so as entirely to defend it from the
mercury afterwards to be used. When cold, the
potash was solid, but containing moisture enough
to give it a conducting power; he then filled the
rest of the tube with mercury, and inverted it
over the trough: the apparatus being thus arranged,
he made the wire and the mercury alternately positive
and negative. And now, conceiving that I
have sufficiently explained his brief notes, the reader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
shall receive the result in his own words: for this
purpose I have obtained an engraving of the autograph,
which is here annexed; but as it may not be
very readily deciphered, I shall first give the substance
of it in print.&mdash;"When potash was introduced
into a tube having a platina wire attached to
it&mdash;so&mdash;and fused into the tube so as to be a conductor,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> so as to contain just water enough,
though solid, and inserted over mercury, when the
platina was made negative, no gas was formed, and
the mercury became oxydated, and a small quantity
of the <em>alkaligen</em> was produced round the platina
wire, as was evident from its quick inflammation
by the action of water. When the mercury was
made the negative, gas was developed in great
quantities from the positive wire, and none from
the negative mercury, and this gas proved to be
pure oxygene&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Capital Experiment, Proving
the Decomposition of Potash</span>." The Reviewer
of the Institution Journal well observes
that those who knew Davy will best conceive the
enthusiasm with which this hasty record of his
success was dashed off, and will instantly recognise
&#949;&#965;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#945; in his "<span class="smcap">Capital Experiment</span>."</p>

<p>From this same Register, it appears that, in the
preceding month, he was deeply engaged in experiments
on '<em>Antwerp blue</em>,' which he found to consist
of <em>Prussiate of Iron</em> and <em>Alumina</em>, "probably in the
proportion of two-thirds of the former to one-third
of the latter."</p>

<p>On the 6th of October, we learn from the same
source, that he performed a beautiful experiment,
that of producing the vegetation of the carbon of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
the wick of a candle, by placing it between the
wires of the battery.</p>

<p>On the 12th of the preceding September he
addressed a letter to Mr. Gilbert, which is curious,
as it shows that very nearly up to the time of the
decomposition of the alkalies, his mind had been
engaged on very different subjects.</p>

In the year 1808, MM. Gay Lussac and Thénard
succeeded in decomposing potash by chemical
means; for which purpose it is only necessary to
heat iron turnings to whiteness in a curved gun-barrel,
and then to bring melted potash slowly in
contact with the turnings, air being excluded; when
the iron, at that high temperature, will take the
oxygen from the alkali, and the potassium may be
collected in a cool part of the tube. It may likewise
be produced by igniting potash with charcoal,
as M. Curaudau showed in the same year.</p>

<p>In the following letter, Davy gives an account of

<p>It is impossible to reflect upon the chemical processes
by which potassium may be obtained, without
feeling surprised that the discovery should not have
long before been accomplished. It is evident that
the substance must have been repeatedly developed
during the operations of chemistry; alkalies had
been frequently heated to whiteness in contact both
with iron and charcoal, and in some instances the
appearance of a highly combustible body, which
could have been no other than potassium, had even
been observed as a result of the process, and yet no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
suspicion, as to its real nature, ever crossed the mind
of the experimentalist; he satisfied himself with
designating such a product, whenever it occurred,
by the term <em>Pyrophorus</em>.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> I remember the late Mr.
William Gregor informing me that, in the course of
his analytical experiments with potash and different
metals, he had repeatedly observed a combustion on
removing the crucible from the furnace, and exposing
its contents, which he could never understand.
How admirably do such anecdotes illustrate
the remark made in the commencement of the present
chapter, that truth may be often touched, but
is rarely caught, in the dark!</p>

<p>The facility of the combustion of the bases of
the alkalies, and the readiness with which they decomposed
water, offered Davy the ready means for
determining the proportions of their constituent
parts: and in comparing all his results, he thinks
that it will be a good approximation to the truth,
to consider potash as composed of about six parts
base and one of oxygen; and soda, as consisting of
seven base and two of oxygen.</p>

<p>The discovery of potassium led to that of the true
nature of what had been long familiar to chemists
by the name of <em>pure Potash</em>, but which ought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
have been called the <em>hydrat</em>, for the <em>pure</em> alkali was
not known until after the discovery of Davy. The
experiments of MM. Gay Lussac and Thénard
have shown this substance to be a <em>Protoxide</em>. It is
difficult of fusion; it has a grey colour and a vitreous
fracture, and dissolves in water with much
heat. The <em>Peroxide</em> is procured by the combustion
of potassium at a low temperature; it had been
observed by Davy in October 1807, but at that time
he supposed it to be the oxide containing the smallest
proportion of oxygen: it has a yellow colour,
and when thrown into water effervesces, and gives
out oxygen gas.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> When heated very strongly upon
platina, oxygen is also expelled from it, and there
remains the <em>protoxide</em>, or pure potash.</p>

<p>It was a great object with Davy, to show that
the product resulting from the combustion of potassium,
was a pure oxide free from water; for it is
evident that had potassium been a <em>Hydruret</em>, its
combustion must have produced a <em>Hydrat</em>. This
he accomplished by a series of experiments which
he performed in the laboratory of Mr. Children,
and which are published in his Bakerian Lecture
of 1800.</p>

<p>Having discovered the presence of oxygen in the
fixed alkalies, he was naturally led by analogy to
enquire whether ammonia might not also contain it.
It was true that the chemical composition of that
body had been considered as satisfactorily settled,
and that the conversion of it into hydrogen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
nitrogen, in the experiments of Scheele, Priestley,
and Berthollet, had left nothing farther to be accomplished.
All new facts, however, are necessarily accompanied
by a new train of analogies; and Davy,
in perusing the accounts of the various experiments
to which ammonia had been submitted, tells us that
he saw no reason for considering the presence of
oxygen as impossible; for, supposing hydrogen and
nitrogen to exist in combination with oxygen in
low proportion, this latter principle might easily
disappear in the analytical experiments by heat and
electricity, in the form of water deposited upon
the vessels employed, or dissolved in the gases
produced.</p>

<p>Under this impression, he commenced a series
of experiments by which, he says, he soon became
satisfied of the existence of oxygen in the volatile
alkali. By means of the Voltaic battery, he ignited
perfectly dry charcoal in a small quantity of pure
ammoniacal gas, and he produced carbonate of ammonia;
which could not have happened, had not
oxygen been furnished by the volatile alkali to the
carbon. In the next place, by an ingenious arrangement
of apparatus, he submitted ammonia to a high
temperature, and effected its decomposition, when
a quantity of water appeared as one of the products.
It will be useless to enter into farther details upon
this occasion, as we shall presently perceive the subject
assumed a different aspect, and led the experimentalist
into a new line of enquiry.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of his Bakerian Lecture of
1807, he speaks of the probable composition of the
earths, and considers it reasonable to expect that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
they are compounds of a similar nature to the
fixed alkalies&mdash;"peculiar highly combustible metallic
bases united to oxygen;"&mdash;but, as yet, this
theory was sanctioned only by strong analogies; it
was his good fortune, at a subsequent period, to
support it by conclusive facts.</p>

<p>When the importance and novelty of the results
he obtained from the fixed alkalies, and their influence
upon the reigning theories, are duly considered,
it may be easily imagined how intense was
the curiosity to witness the production of the new
metals, to examine their singular qualities, and to
question the illustrious discoverer upon their nature
and relations. Suppose it were publicly announced
that one of the greatest Astronomers of the day
had invented a telescope of new and extraordinary
powers; and that by its means a hitherto unsuspected
system of heavenly bodies might be seen,
the character and motions of which were wholly inconsistent
with the Newtonian theory of the universe.
The surprise and eager curiosity which such
an announcement would create might possibly be
more general, because a knowledge of Astronomy
is more widely diffused than that of Chemistry;
but the sensation would not be more intense than
that which the discovery of potassium produced.
The laboratory of the Institution was crowded with
persons of every rank and description; and Davy,
as may be readily supposed, was kept in a continued
state of excitement throughout the day. This circumstance,
co-operating with the effects of the
fatigue he had previously undergone, produced a
most severe fit of illness, which for a time caused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
an awful pause in his researches, broke the thread
of his pursuits, and turned his reflections into different
channels.</p>

<p>He always laboured under the impression that
the fever had been occasioned by contagion, to
which he had been exposed in one of the jails
during an experiment for fumigating it. This
impression appears to have continued through
life, for in his "Last Days" he alludes to it in terms
of strong conviction.</p>

<p>Other persons referred his illness to the deleterious
fumes, especially those of Baryta, to which his
experiments had exposed him: an opinion recorded
in an Epigram,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> which was circulated amongst the
members of the Institution after his recovery.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Says Davy to Baryt, "I've a strong inclination</div>
<div class="line">To try to effect your deoxidation;"</div>
<div class="line">But Baryt replies&mdash;"Have a care of your mirth,</div>
<div class="line">Lest I should retaliate, and change <em>you</em> to Earth."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Upon conversing, however, with Dr. Babington,
who, with Dr. Frank, attended Davy throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
this illness, he assured me that there was not the
slightest ground for either of these opinions; that
the fever was evidently the effect of fatigue and an
over-excited brain. The reader will not feel much
hesitation in believing this statement, when he is
made acquainted with the habits of Davy at this
period. His intellectual exertions were of the most
injurious kind, and yet, unlike the philosophers of
old, he sought not to fortify himself by habits of
temperance. Should any of my readers propose to
me the same question respecting Davy, as Fontenelle
tells us was put to an Englishman in Paris,
by a scientific Marquis, with regard to Newton,&mdash;whether
he ate, drank, and slept like other people?&mdash;I
certainly should be bound to answer in the
negative.</p>

<p>Such was his great celebrity at this period of his
career, that persons of the highest rank contended
for the honour of his company at dinner, and he did
not possess sufficient resolution to resist the gratification
thus afforded, although it generally happened
that his pursuits in the laboratory were not suspended
until the appointed dinner-hour had passed.
On his return in the evening, he resumed his chemical
labours, and commonly continued them till three
or four o'clock in the morning; and yet the servants
of the establishment not unfrequently found that
he had risen before them. The greatest of all his
wants was Time, and the expedients by which he
economised it often placed him in very ridiculous
positions, and gave rise to habits of the most eccentric
description: driven to an extremity, he would
in his haste put on fresh linen, without removing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
that which was underneath; and, singular as the
fact may appear, he has been known, after the
fashion of the grave-digger in Hamlet, to wear no
less than five shirts, and as many pair of stockings,
at the same time. Exclamations of surprise very
frequently escaped from his friends at the rapid
manner in which he increased and declined in
corpulence.</p>

<p>At the commencement of his severe illness in
November 1807, he was immediately attended by
Dr. Babington and Dr. Frank; and upon its assuming
a more serious aspect, these gentlemen were
assisted by Dr. Baillie. Such was the alarming
state of the patient, that for many weeks his physicians
regularly visited him four times in the day,
and issued bulletins for the information of the numerous
enquirers who anxiously crowded the hall
of the Institution. His kind and amiable qualities
had secured the attachment of all the officers and
servants of the establishment, and they eagerly anticipated
every want his situation might require.
The housekeeper, Mrs. Greenwood, watched over
him with all the care and solicitude of a parent;
and, with the exception of a single night, never
retired to her bed for the period of eleven weeks.
In the latter stage of his illness, he was reduced to
the extreme of weakness, and his mind participated
in the debility of the body. It may not perhaps be
thought philosophical to deduce any inference, as
to character, from traits which are displayed under
such circumstances: I have little doubt, however,
but that the mind, like inorganic matter, will, in
its decay, frequently develope important elements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
which under other conditions were not distinguishable.
Suppose pride and timidity to exist as qualities
in the same mind, the former might so far
predominate as to enable its possessor to face the
cannon's mouth; but diminish its force by moral or
physical agency, the natural timidity will gain the
ascendency, and the hero be converted into a coward.
Such are my reasons for introducing the following
anecdote: I would not give to it a greater value
than it deserves, but it surely demonstrates the
existence of kindly affections. Youthful reminiscences,
and circumstances connected with his family
and friends, were the only objects which, at this
period, occupied his thoughts, and afforded him
any pleasure. No Swiss peasant ever sighed more
deeply for his native mountains, than did Davy
for the scenes of his early years. He entreated his
nurse to convey to his friends his ardent wish to
obtain some apples from a particular tree which
he had planted when a boy; and, unlike Locke
with his cherries, he had no power of controlling
the desire by his reason, but remained in a state of
restlessness and impatience until their arrival: at
the same time, he expressed a wish to obtain several
other objects, especially an ancient tea-pot, endeared
to him by early associations.</p>

<p>The following Minute appears on the Journals of
the Institution:&mdash;</p>

<p>"December 7, 1807.&mdash;Mr. Davy having been
confined to his bed for the last fortnight by a severe
illness, the Managers are under the painful necessity
of giving notice, that the Lectures will not commence
until the first week in January next."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
The Course was, at the time stated, opened by
the Reverend Mr. (now Dr.) Dibdin; and his introductory
lecture was, by order of the Managers,
printed "for the satisfaction of those proprietors
who were not present." It thus commences:&mdash;"Before
I solicit your attention to the opening of
those Lectures which I shall have the honour of
delivering in the course of the season, permit me
to trespass upon it for a few minutes, by stating the
peculiar circumstances under which this Institution
is again opened; and how it comes to pass that it
has fallen to me, rather than to a more deserving
lecturer, to be the first to address you.</p>

<p>"The Managers have requested me to impart to
you that intelligence, which no one who is alive to
the best feelings of human nature can hear without
mixed emotions of sorrow and delight.</p>

<p>"Mr. Davy, whose frequent and powerful addresses
from this place, supported by his ingenious
experiments, have been so long and so well known
to you, has for these last five weeks been struggling
between life and death;&mdash;the effects of those experiments
recently made in illustration of his splendid
discoveries, added to consequent bodily weakness,
brought on a fever so violent as to threaten the
extinction of life. Over him, it might emphatically
be said, in the language of our immortal Milton, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i3">           &mdash;&mdash;'Death his dart</div>
<div class="line">Shook, but delayed to strike.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Had it pleased Providence to have deprived the
world of any further benefit from his original talents
and immense application, there certainly has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
been already enough effected by him to entitle his
name to a place amongst the brightest scientific
luminaries of his country. That this may not appear
an unfounded eulogium, I shall proceed, at the
particular request of the Managers, to give you an
outline of the splendid discoveries to which I have
just alluded; and I do so with the greater pleasure,
as that outline has been drawn in a very masterly
manner by a gentleman of all others perhaps the
best qualified to do it effectually."</p>

<p>The Lecturer then proceeded to take a general
and rapid view of his labours, which it is unnecessary
to introduce in this place, and concluded as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This recital will be sufficient to convince those
who have heard it of the celebrity which the author
of such discoveries has a right to attach to himself;
and yet no one, I am confident, has less inclination
to challenge it. To us, and to every enlightened
Englishman, it will be a matter of just congratulation,
that the country which has produced the two
<span class="smcap">Bacons</span> and <span class="smcap">Boyle</span>, has in these latter days shown
itself worthy of its former renown by the labours of
<span class="smcap">Cavendish</span> and <span class="smcap">Davy</span>. The illness of the latter,
severe as it has been, is now abating, and we may
reasonably hope that the period of convalescence is
not very remote."</p>

<p>Fortunately for the cause of Science&mdash;fortunately
for the interests of the Institution, the prediction of
the learned Lecturer was shortly verified.</p>

<p>The Institution, indeed, had already suffered from
the calamity; for, in a Report to the Visitors, dated
January 25, 1808, it is stated, that "there has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
been an excess of expenditure beyond the receipts.
Among the causes of diminished income may be
mentioned the postponement of the lectures, in consequence
of the lamented illness of the excellent
Professor of Chemistry; and among the items of
increased expenditure, the extra expense of the Laboratory,
in which have been produced Mr. Davy's
recent discoveries, so honourable to the Royal Institution,
and so beneficial to the interests of science
in every part of the world."</p>

<p>This Report is succeeded by the following Minute:&mdash;</p>

<p>"February 22, 1808.&mdash;Mr. Davy attended at the
request of the Committee, and informed them that
he should be able to commence his course of
Lectures on Electro-chemical science on Saturday
the 12th of March, at two o'clock; and those on
Geology on Wednesday evening, the 16th of that
month."</p>

<p>The following letter to Mr. Poole announces the
restoration of his health, and communicates some
other circumstances of interest. Mr. Poole, it would
appear, entertained doubts as to whether Davy received
the prize of France for his first or second
Bakerian Lecture, upon which point this letter sets
him right.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date"> March, 1808.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>Many thanks for your kind letter. I have seen
your friend Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; for a minute, and, to use a
geological term, I like his <em>aspect</em>, and shall endeavour
to cultivate his acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
I am exceedingly busy; my health is re-established;
and I am entering again into the career of
experiment.</p>

<p>The prize which you congratulate me upon was
given for my paper of 1806, and not for my last discoveries,
which will probably excite more interest.</p>

<p>C&mdash;&mdash;, after disappointing his audience twice
from illness, is announced to lecture again this
week. He has suffered greatly from excessive sensibility&mdash;the
disease of genius. His mind is as a
wilderness, in which the cedar and the oak, which
might aspire to the skies, are stunted in their growth
by underwood, thorns, briars, and parasitical plants.
With the most exalted genius, enlarged views, sensitive
heart, and enlightened mind, he will be the
victim of want of order, precision, and regularity.
I cannot think of him without experiencing the
mingled feelings of admiration, regard, and pity.</p>

<p>Why do you not come to London? Many
would be happy to see you; but no one more so
than your very sincere friend, my dear Poole,</p>

<p class="signature smcap">H. Davy.</p>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of the
universal interest which was excited by the lectures
on Electro-chemical Science, to which an allusion
has been just made. The Theatre of the Institution
overflowed; and each succeeding lecture increased
the number of candidates for admission.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary, after what has been already
stated, to describe the masterly style in which he
demonstrated and explained those general laws
which his genius had developed, or to enumerate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
the beautiful and diversified experiments by which
he illustrated their application, in simplifying the
more complex forms of matter.</p>

<p>His evening lectures on Geology were equally
attractive; and by a method as novel as it was beautiful,
he exhibited, by the aid of transparencies, the
structure of mountains, the stratification of rocks,
and the arrangements of mineral veins.</p>

<p>The Easter recess afforded him a few days of leisure,
which from the following note he appears to
have devoted to his favourite amusement.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO W. H. PEPYS, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date"> April, 1808.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR PEPYS,</p>

<p>Children has had the kindness to arrange our
party, and we are to meet him, at all events, on
Tuesday at two o'clock, at Foot's Cray.</p>

<p>I have proposed that we should leave town at
about five or six on Monday evening, sleep at Foot's
Cray, and try the fly-fishing there.</p>

<p>Will you arrange with Allen, whom we must
initiate in the vocation of the Apostles, as he wants
nothing else to make him perfect as a primitive
Christian and a Philosopher?</p>

<p class="signature">I am, my dear Pepys,<br />
<span class="j4">Most affectionately yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Hitherto his passion for angling has only been
noticed in connection with his conversation and
letters; I shall now present to the reader a sketch
of the philosopher in his fishing costume. His
whole suit consisted of green cloth; the coat having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
sundry pockets for holding the necessary tackle:
his boots were made of caoutchouc, and, for the
convenience of wading through the water, reached
above the knees. His hat, originally intended for
a coal-heaver, had been purchased from the manufacturer
in its raw state, and dyed green by some
pigment of his own composition; it was, moreover,
studded with every variety of artificial fly which he
could require for his diversion. Thus equipped, he
thought, from the colour of his dress, that he was
more likely to elude the observation of the fish.
He looked not like an inhabitant o' the earth, and
yet was on't;&mdash;nor can I find any object in the
regions of invention with which I could justly compare
him, except perhaps with one of those grotesque
personages who, in the farce of "The Critic," attend
Father Thames on the stage, as his two banks.</p>

<p>I shall take this opportunity of stating, that his
shooting attire was equally whimsical: if, as an
angler, he adopted a dress for concealing his person,
as a sportsman in woods and plantations, it was his
object to devise means for exposing it; for he always
entertained a singular dread lest he might be
accidentally shot upon these occasions. When upon
a visit to Mr. Dillwyn of Swansea, he accompanied
his friend on a shooting excursion, in a broad-brimmed
hat, the whole of which, with the exception of
the brim, was covered with scarlet cloth.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, however, the refinements which
he displayed in his dress, and the scrupulous attention
with which he observed all the minute details
of the art; if the truth must be told, he was not
more successful than his brother anglers; and here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
again the temperament of Wollaston presented a
characteristic contrast to that of Davy. The former
evinced the same patience and reserve&mdash;the same
cautious observation and unwearied vigilance in this
pursuit, as so eminently distinguished his chemical
labours. The temperament of the latter was far too
mercurial: the fish never seized the fly with sufficient
avidity to fulfill his expectations, or to support
that degree of excitement which was essential
to his happiness, and he became either listless or
angry, and consequently careless and unsuccessful.&mdash;But
it is time to resume the thread of our chemical
history.</p>

<p>It has been already stated, that Davy had no
sooner decomposed the fixed alkalies than he proceeded
to effect an analysis of the earths; but his
results were indistinct: they could not, like the
alkalies, be rendered conductors of electricity by
fusion, nor could they be acted upon in solution, in
consequence of the strong affinity possessed by their
bases for oxygen. The pursuit of the enquiry then
demanded more refined and complicated processes,
than those which had succeeded with potash and
soda.</p>

<p>The only methods which held out any fair prospect
of success were those of operating by electricity
upon the earths in some of their combinations, or of
converting them, at the moment of their decomposition,
into metallic alloys, so as to obtain presumptive
evidence of their nature and properties. Such,
in fact, was the line of enquiry in which Davy was
deeply engaged, when he received from Professor
Berzelius of Stockholm a letter, announcing the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
that he had, in conjunction with Dr. Pontin, succeeded
in decomposing baryta and lime, by negatively
electrising mercury in contact with them, and
that, by such means, he had actually obtained amalgams
of the earths in question.</p>

<p>Our philosopher immediately repeated the experiments,
and with perfect success. After which he
completed a series of additional experiments, which
fully established the nature of these bodies, and the
analogies he had anticipated. These results formed
the subject of a memoir, which was read before the
Royal Society on the 30th of June 1808, and entitled,
"Electro-chemical Researches on the Decomposition
of the Earths: with Observations on
the Metals obtained from them, and on the Amalgam
of Ammonia."</p>

<p>He commences this paper by enumerating the
several trials he had made to effect the decomposition
of these bodies; such as, First, by electrifying
them by iron wires under the surface of naphtha,
with a view to form alloys with iron and the metallic
bases of the earths. Secondly, by heating potassium
in contact with the alkaline earths, in the hope that
this body might detach the oxygen from them, in
the same manner as charcoal decomposes the common
metallic oxides. Thirdly, by submitting various
mixtures of the earths and potash to Voltaic
action, with the idea that the potash and the earths
might be deoxidated at the same time, and entering
into combination, form alloys. Fourthly, by mixing
together various earths with the oxides of tin, iron,
lead, silver, and mercury: a mode of manipulation
suggested by the results of his previous experiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
on potassium, in which he found that when a mixture
of potash and the oxides of mercury, tin, or
lead, was electrified in the Voltaic circuit, the decomposition
was very rapid, and an amalgam, or
an alloy of potassium, was obtained; the attraction
between the common metals and the potassium
apparently accelerating the separation of the
oxygen.</p>

<p>Supposing that a similar kind of action might assist
the decomposition of the alkaline earths, he proceeded
to institute a series of experiments upon that
principle; and the results were more satisfactory
than those obtained by the preceding methods of
experimenting&mdash;a compound was obtained which
acted upon water with the evolution of hydrogen,
producing a solution of the earth, and leaving free
the tin, or lead, with which its base may be supposed
to have been alloyed;&mdash;but in all such experiments
the quantity of the metallic basis produced
must have been very minute, and its character very
questionable.</p>

<p>In this stage of the enquiry, Davy received the
letter from Professor Berzelius of Stockholm, the
contents of which he embodied in his memoir, accompanied
with such observations as his own information
suggested.</p>

<p>"A globule of mercury, electrified by the power
of a battery consisting of five hundred pairs of double
plates of six inches square, weakly charged, was
made to act upon a surface of slightly moistened
barytes, fixed upon a plate of platina. The mercury
gradually became less fluid, and after a few minutes
was found covered with a white film of barytes; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
when the amalgam was thrown into water, hydrogen
was disengaged, the mercury remained free, and
a solution of barytes was formed.</p>

<p>"The result with lime, as these gentlemen had
stated, was precisely analogous.</p>

<p>"That the same happy methods must succeed
with strontites and magnesia, it was not easy to
doubt, and I quickly tried the experiment. From
strontites I obtained a very rapid result; but from
magnesia, in the first trials, no amalgam could be
procured. By continuing the process, however, for
a longer time, and keeping the earth continually
moist, at last a combination of the bases with mercury
was obtained, which slowly produced magnesia,
by absorption of oxygen from air, or by the
action of water.</p>

<p>"All these amalgams I found might be preserved
for a considerable period under naphtha. In a
length of time, however, they became covered with
a white crust under this fluid. When exposed to
air, a very few minutes only were required for the
oxygenation of the bases of the earths. In the
water the amalgam of barytes was most rapidly decomposed;
that of strontites, and that of lime next
in order: but the amalgam from magnesia, as might
have been expected from the weak affinity of the
earth for water, very slowly changed: when, however,
a little sulphuric acid was added to the water,
the evolution of hydrogen, and the production and
solution of magnesia, were exceedingly rapid, and
the mercury soon remained free."</p>

<p>In order, if possible, to procure the amalgams in
quantities sufficient for distillation, he combined the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
methods he had employed in the first instance, with
those pursued by Berzelius and Pontin. "A mixture
of the earth with red oxide of mercury was
placed on a plate of platina, a cavity was made in
the upper part of it to receive a globule of mercury,
the whole was covered by a film of naphtha, and the
plate was made positive, and the mercury negative,
by a proper communication with the battery of five
hundred."</p>

<p>The amalgams thus procured were afterwards distilled
in glass tubes filled with the vapour of naphtha;
by which operation the mercury rose pure from
the amalgam, and it was very easy to separate a part
of it; but the difficulty was to obtain a complete
decomposition, for to effect this, a high temperature
was required, and at a red heat the bases of the
earths instantly acted upon the glass, and became
oxidated.</p>

<p>In the best result which Davy obtained in this
manner, the barytic basis appeared as a white metal
of the colour of silver, fixed at all common temperatures,
but fluid at a heat below redness, and volatile
at a heat above it. Unlike the alkaline bases, it
would seem to be considerably heavier than water.</p>

<p>In extending these experiments to alumine, silex,
zircone, &amp;c. after a most elaborate investigation,
such results were not obtained as justified the conclusion
that they were, like the other earths, metallic
oxides; although, as far as they went, they added
to the probability of such analogy.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, after the fixed alkalies
had been found to contain oxygen, Davy was
very naturally led to enquire whether ammonia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
might not also contain the same element, or be an
oxide with a binary base. In the communication
from Professor Berzelius, and Dr. Pontin, already
alluded to, a most curious experiment is related on
what they consider the deoxidation and amalgamation
of the compound basis of ammonia; and which
they regard as supporting the idea which Davy had
formed of the presence of oxygen<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> in the volatile
alkali. A fact so startling as the production of a
metallic body from ammonia, or from its elements,
immediately excited in Davy's mind the most ardent
desire to pursue the enquiry; and, after repeating
the original experiments of the Swedish
chemists with his accustomed sagacity, he modified
his methods of manipulation, in order, if possible, to
obtain this metallic body in its most simple form;
but, although he succeeded in producing the amalgam
without Voltaic aid, by the intervention of potassium,
he could not so distill off the mercury as to
leave the basis, or imaginary <em>ammonium</em>, free.</p>

<p>The history of these researches into the nature of
the ammoniacal element concludes the lecture of
which I have endeavoured to give an outline. The
subject of the amalgam is still involved in mystery:
if we suppose with Davy, that a substance, which
forms so perfect an amalgam with mercury, must of
necessity be metallic in its own nature, we cannot
but conclude either that hydrogen and nitrogen are
both metals in the aëriform state, at the usual temperatures
of the atmosphere&mdash;bodies, for example,
of the same character as zinc and quicksilver would
be at the heat of ignition&mdash;or, that these gases are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
oxides in their common form, but which become
metallized by deoxidation&mdash;or, that they are simple
bodies, not metallic in their own nature, but capable
of composing a metal in their deoxygenated, and an
alkali in their oxygenated, state.</p>

<p>Before we venture, however, to entertain any
opinions so extravagant in their nature, and so
wholly unsupported by analogy, it would be well to
enquire how far the change, which ammonia and
mercury undergo by Voltaic action, really merits
the name of amalgamation. Several chemists of the
present day are inclined to refer this change of form
to a purely mechanical cause, by which the particles
of the metal become separated, and converted, as it
were, into a kind of <em>froth</em> by the operation.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Mr. Brande, in a late communication in the Journal
of the Royal Institution,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> observes: "Shortly
after the discovery of a method of obtaining Morphia
in a pure state, I remember that Sir Humphry
Davy suggested the possibility of its affording,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
when electrised in contact with mercury, results
corresponding with those which Berzelius had observed
in respect to ammonia. He thought that
the nascent elements of the morphia, as liberated by
electrical decomposition, might, under such circumstances,
effect a similar apparent amalgam of the
mercury, and he spoke of the subject as likely to
throw some light upon the corresponding ammoniacal
combinations. He made, I believe, a few
experiments upon the subject; but as the results
were not such as he had anticipated, they were not
placed on record."</p>

<p>In the progress of our ascent, it is refreshing to
pause occasionally, and to cast a glance at the horizon,
which widens at every increase of our elevation.
By the decomposition of the alkalies and earths,
what an immense stride has been made in the investigation
of nature!&mdash;In sciences kindred to chemistry,
the knowledge of the composition of these
bodies, and the analogies arising from it, have opened
new views, and led to the solution of many problems.
In Geology, for instance, has it not shown
that agents may have operated in the formation of
rocks and earths, which had not previously been
known to exist? It is evident that the metals of
the earths cannot remain at the surface of our globe;
but it is probable that they may constitute a part of
its interior; and such an assumption would at once
offer a plausible theory in explanation of the phenomena
of volcanoes, the formation of lavas, and the
excitement and effects of subterranean heat, and
might even lead to a general theory in Geology.</p>

<p>The reader, for the present, must be satisfied with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
these cursory hints: I shall hereafter show that our
illustrious philosopher followed them up by numerous
observations and original experiments in a
volcanic country.</p>

<p>I remember with delight the beautiful illustration
of his theory, as exhibited in an artificial volcano
constructed in the theatre of the Royal Institution.&mdash;A
mountain had been modelled in clay, and a
quantity of the metallic bases introduced into its
interior: on water being poured upon it, the metals
were soon thrown into violent action&mdash;successive
explosions followed&mdash;red-hot lava was seen flowing
down its sides, from a crater in miniature&mdash;mimic
lightnings played around: and in the instant of
dramatic illusion, the tumultuous applause and continued
cheering of the audience might almost have
been regarded as the shouts of the alarmed fugitives
of Herculaneum or Pompeii.</p>

<p>The third Bakerian Lecture, which Davy read before
the Royal Society in December 1808, is entitled
"An Account of some new analytical Researches on
the Nature of certain Bodies, particularly the Alkalies,
Phosphorus, Sulphur, Carbonaceous matter, and
the Acids hitherto undecompounded; with some
general Observations on Chemical Theory."</p>

<p>The object of this lecture was to communicate
the results of numerous experiments which had
been instituted for the purpose of still farther
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
extending our knowledge of the elements of matter,
by the new powers and methods arising from the
application of electricity to chemical analysis.</p>

<p>Important as were the facts thus obtained, they
disappointed the expectation of those who did not
consider, that the more nearly we approach ultimate
analysis,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> the greater must be the difficulties, the
more numerous the fallacies, and the less perfect
the results, of our processes. In fact, his former
discoveries had spoilt us: their splendour had left
our organs of perception incapable of receiving
just impressions from any minor lights, and we participated
with exaggerated feelings, in the disappointment
which he himself expressed at several of
his results. The confidence inspired by his former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
triumphs may be compared to that which is felt by
an army, when commanded by a victorious General,&mdash;a
conviction that, however difficult may be
the enterprise, it must be accomplished by the genius
of him who undertakes it. The moment we
discovered that Davy was laying siege to one of
Nature's strongest holds,&mdash;that he was attempting
to resolve nitrogen into other elementary forms,&mdash;we
regarded the deed as already accomplished, and
the repulse which followed most unreasonably produced
a feeling of dissatisfaction. Upon such occasions,
the severity of our disappointment will always
be in proportion to the importance of the object we
desire to accomplish; and it is impossible not to
feel that the discovery of the true nature of nitrogen
would lead to new views in chemistry, the
extent of which it is not easy even to imagine.</p>

<p>The principal objects of research which this paper
embraces are,&mdash;the elementary matter of ammonia;
the nature of phosphorus, sulphur, charcoal, and
the diamond; and the constituents of the boracic,
fluoric, and muriatic acids. Enquiries which are
continued and extended in two successive papers,
viz. in one read before the Society in February
1809, entitled "New Analytical Researches on the
Nature of certain Bodies; being an Appendix to
his Bakerian Lecture of 1808;" and in his fourth
Bakerian Lecture of 1809, "On some new Electro-chemical
Researches on various Objects, particularly
the Metallic bodies from the Alkalies and Earths;
and on some Combinations of Hydrogen."</p>

<p>With regard to these admirable papers,&mdash;for such
they must undoubtedly be considered,&mdash;the biographer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
must confine his observations to their general
character and results. They are far too refined to
admit of a brief analysis, and too elaborate to allow
a successful abridgement. A just idea of their
merit can alone be derived from a direct reference
to the Philosophical Transactions.</p>

<p>The enquiry commences with experiments on the
results produced by the mutual action of potassium
and ammonia on each other. His object was twofold:
to refute the hypothesis which assumed hydrogen
as an element of potassium, and to ascertain
the nature of the matter existing in the amalgam of
ammonia, or the supposed metallic basis of the volatile
alkali: a question intimately connected with the
whole of the arrangements of chemistry. As to the
former point, it is unnecessary to enter into farther
discussion; and with regard to the latter, it is quite
impossible to convey an adequate idea of the extent
of the enquiry: there does not exist in the annals of
chemistry a more striking example of experimental
industry.</p>

<p>In the course of his experiments on potassium
and ammonia, he obtained an olive-coloured body,
which he was inclined to regard as a compound of
the metallic base of ammonia (<em>ammonium</em>) and potassium;
and on submitting which to various trials,
he uniformly obtained, as the product of its decomposition,
a proportion of nitrogen considerably less
than that which, upon calculations founded on a
rigid analysis of the volatile alkali, ought to have
been afforded under such circumstances, while the
potassium employed at the same time became oxidated.
This result inspired a hope that nitrogen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
might have been actually decomposed during the
process, and that its elements were oxygen and a
metallic basis, or oxygen and hydrogen.</p>

<p>That he was sanguine in that hope, appears from
the whole tenor of his paper; in farther proof of
which, I can adduce a letter which he addressed to
Mr. Children during the progress of his experiments,
in which he says, "I hope on Thursday to
show you nitrogen as a complete wreck, torn to
pieces in different ways." His subsequent enquiries,
however, although they did not strengthen the
suspicion he had formed respecting the decomposition
of that body, yet indirectly developed facts of
considerable importance; which, with his characteristic
quickness of perception, he made subservient
to fresh investigation.</p>

<p>His researches into the phenomena exhibited by
tellurium, when forming a part of the Voltaic circuit,
are highly interesting. It had been stated by
Ritter, that, of all the metallic substances he tried
for producing potassium by negative electricity,
tellurium was the only one by which he could not
procure it; and he uses this fact in support of his
opinion, that potassium is a <em>hydruret</em>. He says,
that when a circuit of electricity is completed in
water by means of two surfaces of tellurium, oxygen
is given off at the positive surface, and instead
of hydrogen at the negative surface, a brown powder
is formed and separated, which he regards as a
<em>hydruret</em> of tellurium; and he conceives that the
reason why that metal prevents the metallization of
potash is, that it has a stronger attraction for hydrogen
than that possessed by the alkali.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Davy's attention was naturally arrested by such a
statement, and, in pursuing the enquiry, he discovered
a series of new facts:&mdash;he found that tellurium
and hydrogen were capable of combining, and
of forming a gas, to which he gave the name of
<em>telluretted hydrogen</em>,&mdash;that, so far from tellurium
preventing the decomposition of potash, it formed
an alloy with potassium when negatively electrified
upon the alkali&mdash;and, such was the intense affinity
of potassium and tellurium for each other, that the
decomposition of potash might be effected by acting
on the oxide of the latter metal and the alkali, at
the same time, by heated charcoal.</p>

<p>With respect to the next subject of enquiry in
these papers, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> whether sulphur, phosphorus, and
carbon, in their ordinary forms, may not contain
hydrogen, it would appear that from an experiment
performed by Mr. Clayfield, and which Davy witnessed
at Bristol in the year 1799, he was very early
led to suspect the existence of hydrogen in sulphur;
but it was not until 1807, that he entered upon the
investigation of the subject. From the general
tenor of his experiments he concluded that, in its
common state, it may be regarded as a compound,
of small quantities of oxygen and hydrogen, with
a large quantity of a basis which, on account of its
strong attractions for other bodies, has not hitherto
been obtained in its pure form. The same analogies
apply to phosphorus and carbon. His conclusion
was mainly derived from the fact, that hydrogen
is produced from sulphur and phosphorus
in such quantities by Voltaic electricity, that he
thinks it cannot well be considered as an accidental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
ingredient in them: the presence of oxygen, he
contends, may be inferred from the circumstance
that, when potassium is made to act upon these
bodies, the sulphurets and phosphurets so formed
evolve by the action of an acid less hydrogen, in
the form of compound inflammable gas, than the
same quantity of potassium in an uncombined state.
The question, however, still remains in considerable
doubt; and in his "Elements of Chemical Philosophy,"
published four years afterwards, he admits
that no accurate conclusions have been formed on
the subject.</p>

<p>In his second Bakerian Lecture of 1807, Davy had
given an account of an experiment in which boracic
acid appeared to be decomposed by Voltaic electricity,
a dark-coloured inflammable substance separating
from it on the negative surface. In the memoir
now under consideration, he procured the basis
by heating together boracic acid and potassium,
when he ascertained it to be a peculiar inflammable
matter, which, after various experiments upon its
nature, he was inclined to regard as metallic; on
which account he proposed for it the name of <em>Boracium</em>.
At about the same period, MM. Gay Lussac
and Thénard were engaged in investigating the
same subject in France, and they anticipated him
in some of the results.</p>

<p>When Davy, by subsequent experiments, had
ascertained that the base of the boracic acid is more
analogous to carbon than to any other substance, he
adopted the term <em>Boron</em>, as less exceptionable than
that of <em>Boracium</em>.</p>

<p>At this time, he also entered upon the investigation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
of fluoric acid, the results of which must be
reserved for future consideration.</p>

<p>His experiments and reasonings upon muriatic
acid, at this period of his career, must be now considered
as deriving their greatest degree of interest
from their fallacy; and they deserve an examination
in this work, if it be only to estimate the vigour
he subsequently displayed in disentangling himself
from a web of his own fabrication. The most satisfactory
proof of intellectual strength is to be found
in the existence of a power which enables the mind
to conquer its prejudices and to correct its own
errors. How many remarkable instances does the
history of science present, in which the philosopher
has treated his facts as Procrustes did his victims, in
order that they might accord with the measure most
convenient for his purpose!</p>

<p>Prejudiced by the general opinion respecting the
hitherto undecompounded nature of muriatic acid,
he had long sought to discover its radical by the
agency of Voltaic electricity; but he uniformly
found that when its aqueous solution was thus
acted upon, the water alone underwent decomposition;
while the electrization of the gas afforded
no other indication of its nature than the presence
of a much greater quantity of water than theory
had assigned to it. He proceeded, therefore, to
examine the acid by other modes of enquiry: he
found, by the action of potassium upon the gas,
that a large volume of hydrogen was evolved,
which, in conjunction with other experiments, satisfied
him that this body, in its common aëriform
state, contained at least one-third of its weight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
water; and he adopted various expedients with the
hopes of obtaining the acid free from it. Without
pursuing him through this research, I shall merely
state the conclusions at which he arrived, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> that
dry muriatic acid, could it be obtained, would probably
be found to possess the strongest and most
extensive powers of combination of all known substances
belonging to the class of acids; and that
its basis, should it ever be separated in a pure form,
will be one of the most powerful agents in Chemistry.
From the fact of water appearing in a
separate state, and oxymuriatic acid being formed
whenever a metallic oxide was heated in muriatic
acid gas, he was led to consider the muriatic acid
as a compound of a certain base, (not hitherto obtained
in a separate state,) and not less than one-third
part of water; while he regarded oxymuriatic
acid as a compound of the same base (free
from water) with oxygen.</p>

<p>After the numerous experiments in which the
original battery of the Institution had been used,
so greatly were its metallic plates corroded, that
it was found to be no longer serviceable; in consequence
of which, as it would appear from a minute,
dated July 11, 1808, "Mr. Davy laid before
the Managers of the Royal Institution the following
paper, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i></p>

<p>"A new path of discovery having been opened
in the agencies of the electrical battery of Volta,
which promises to lead to the greatest improvements
in Chemistry and Natural Philosophy, and
the useful arts connected with them; and since
the increase of the size of the apparatus is absolutely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
necessary for pursuing it to its full extent,
it is proposed to raise a fund by subscription, for
constructing a powerful battery, worthy of a national
establishment, and capable of promoting the
great objects of science.</p>

<p>"Already, in other countries, public and ample
means have been provided for pursuing these investigations.
They have had their origin in this
country; and it would be dishonourable to a nation
so great, so powerful, and so rich, if, from
the want of pecuniary resources, they should be
completed abroad.</p>

<p>"An appeal to enlightened individuals on this
subject can scarcely be made in vain. It is proposed
that the instrument and apparatus be erected
in the Laboratory of the Royal Institution, where
it shall be employed in the advancement of this
new department of science."</p>

<p>The Minute goes on then to state that&mdash;</p>

<p>"The above paper having been laid before the
Board of Managers, they felt it their indispensable
duty instantly to communicate the same to every
member of the Royal Institution, lest the slightest
delay might furnish an opportunity to other countries
for accomplishing this great work, which originated
in the brilliant discoveries recently made at
the Royal Institution.</p>

<p>"The Managers present agree to subscribe to
this undertaking.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Ordered</span>, that a book be opened at the Steward's
office for the purpose of entering the names
of all those members who may wish to contribute
towards this important National object."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
To the great gratification of Davy, and to the
honour of the country, the list of subscribers was
soon completed, and one of the most magnificent
batteries ever constructed was speedily in full operation.</p>

<p>It is thus alluded to in his Elements of Chemical
Philosophy:&mdash;"The most powerful combination that
exists, in which number of alternations is combined
with extent of surface, is that constructed by the
subscriptions of a few zealous cultivators and patrons
of science, in the Laboratory of the Royal
Institution. It consists of two hundred instruments
connected together in regular order, each
composed of ten double plates arranged in cells
of porcelain, and containing in each plate thirty-two
square inches; so that the whole number of
double plates is two thousand, and the whole surface
one hundred and twenty-eight thousand square
inches."</p>

<p>This battery, when the cells were filled with sixty
parts of water mixed with one part of nitric acid,
afforded a series of brilliant and impressive effects.
When pieces of charcoal, about an inch long, and
one-sixth of an inch in diameter, were brought near
each other, (within the thirtieth or fortieth parts of
an inch,) a bright spark was produced, and more
than half the volume of the charcoal became ignited
to whiteness, and by withdrawing the points from
each other a constant discharge took place through
the heated air, in a space equal at least to four
inches, producing a most brilliant ascending arch of
light, broad and conical in form in the middle.
When any substance was introduced into this arch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
it instantly became ignited; platina melted as readily
in it as wax in the flame of a common candle;
quartz, the sapphire, magnesia, lime, all entered
into fusion; fragments of diamond, and points of
charcoal and plumbago rapidly disappeared, and
seemed to evaporate in it, even when the connexion
was made in a receiver exhausted by the air-pump;
but there was no evidence of their having previously
undergone fusion.</p>

<p>All the phenomena of chemical decomposition
were produced with intense rapidity by this combination.
When the points of charcoal were brought
near each other in non-conducting fluids, such as
oils, ether, and oxymuriatic compounds, brilliant
sparks occurred, and elastic matter was rapidly generated.</p>

<p>Among the numerous experiments performed by
the aid of this battery, he instituted several, in the
hope of decomposing nitrogen; and which are recorded
in his Bakerian Lecture of 1809. He ignited
potassium, by intense Voltaic electricity, in
this gas; and the result was, that hydrogen appeared,
and some nitrogen was found deficient.
This, on first view, led him to the suspicion that he
had attained his object; but, in subsequent experiments,
in proportion as the potassium was more free
from a coating of potash, which necessarily introduced
water, so in proportion was less hydrogen
evolved, and less nitrogen found deficient. The
general tenor of these enquiries, therefore, did not
strengthen the opinion he had formed with respect
to the compound nature of nitrogen.</p>

<p>It appears from the following letter, that Davy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
visited his friend Mr. Andrew Knight at Downton,
in September 1809. It is introduced in these
memoirs principally for the purpose of showing
with what boldness he was accustomed to depart
from generally received opinions, and to project new
theories for the explanation of the most abstruse
subjects.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO JOHN GEORGE CHILDREN, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">  September 23, 1809.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>I am about to visit Downton, and shall return
by the first of October. I have neither seen nor
heard from Lord Darnley, and I conjecture he has
not yet returned from Scotland.</p>

<p>I wish you great sport in pheasant-shooting, but
I trust you have had still nobler game in your
Laboratory.</p>

<p>I doubt not you have found before this, as I have
done, that the substance we mistook for <em>sulphuretted</em>
hydrogen is <em>telluretted</em> hydrogen, very soluble in
water, combinable with alkalies and earths, and a
substance affording another proof that hydrogen is
an oxide. I have met with another analogous compound,
that of <em>boracium</em> with hydrogen, which possesses
very similar properties.</p>

<p>I find that taking <em>ammonium</em> as the basis of hydrogen,
according to the ideas which I stated, all
the compounds will agree with the suppositions that
I mentioned to you, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> eight cubic inches of hydrogen,
two of oxygen, ammonia; four and two,
water; four and four, nitrogen; four and six, nitrous
oxide; four and eight, nitrous gas; four and ten,
nitric acid. Where the multiples are not in geometrical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
order, the decomposition is most easy, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>
in nitrous oxide and nitric acid; more easy in water
than in ammonia; but most difficult in nitrogen,
where there is probably the most perfect equilibrium
of affinities.</p>

<p>I have kept charcoal white hot by the Voltaic
apparatus, in dry oxymuriatic acid gas for an hour,
without effecting its decomposition. This agrees
with what I had before observed with a red heat.
It is as difficult to decompose as nitrogen, except
when all its elements can be made to enter into new
combinations.</p>

<p>I find the radiation, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</i>, from ignited platina,
is to that in air as three to one:&mdash;so much for
Leslie's hypothesis.</p>

<p>A little electrical machine acts with a repulsion as
two, in a vacuum equal to five inches of mercury;
as thirty, in common air; as thirty, in oxygen; as
twenty-nine or thirty, in hydrogen; and as forty-five,
in carbonic acid. I showed this experiment,
made with every precaution, to Mr. Cavendish, Dr.
Herschell, Dr. Wollaston, and Warburton: so much
for the theory, that electricity is dependent upon
oxidation. I do not think our worthy friend Pepys
will resist any longer.</p>

<p>Pray let me know what you have been doing. I
hope you will not suffer these beautiful and satisfactory
experiments of the capacities of metals to
remain still. Write me a letter as egotistical as the

father, and with hopes that we shall soon meet, I
am, my dear friend,</p>

<p class="signature2">Very faithfully and affectionately yours,<br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The genius displayed by Mr. Knight in investigating
the phenomena of vegetable nature, and in
applying the knowledge thus acquired to objects of
practical improvement, excited in Davy, as might
have been expected, feelings of the highest admiration;
and when, in addition to such claims, he was
the acknowledged patron and hospitable friend of
the angler, the reader will readily imagine the
warmth of feeling with which our philosopher cherished
his friendship.</p>

<p>On commencing the present work, I applied to
Mr. Knight for any assistance he might be able to
afford me, in aid of so arduous a labour; and he
very kindly returned an answer, from which I extract
the following passage.</p>

<p>"My late lamented friend, Sir Humphry Davy,
usually paid me a visit in the autumn, when he
chiefly amused himself with angling for grayling, a
fish which he appeared to take great pleasure in
catching. He seemed to enjoy the repose and comparative
solitude of this place, where he met but
few persons, except those of my own family, for we
usually saw but little company. He always assured
me that he passed his visits agreeably, and I had
reason to believe he expressed his real feelings.</p>

<p>"In the familiar conversations of these friendly
visits, he always appeared to me to be a much more
extraordinary being than even his writings, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
vast discoveries, would have led me to suppose him;
and, in the extent of intellectual powers, I shall
ever think that he lived and died without an equal."</p>

<p>The reader has already been made acquainted
with those experiments which led Davy to modify
the prevailing opinions, with regard to the constitution
of the muriatic and oxymuriatic acids; and on
the false assumption that oxygen existed in the latter
gas, to refer the deposition of water which takes
place upon heating a metallic oxide in the former,
to the supposition that muriatic acid contains a large
proportion of water as essential to its composition.
Upon observing, however, that charcoal, if freed
from hydrogen and moisture, even when ignited to
whiteness in oxymuriatic, or muriatic acid gas, by
the Voltaic battery, did not effect the least change
in them, he was led to suspect the accuracy of his
previous conclusion; and on retracing his steps, and
entering upon a new path of enquiry, he ultimately
succeeded, after one of the most acute controversies
that ever sprang from a chemical question, in recalling
philosophers to the original theory of Scheele,
by establishing the important truth, that oxymuriatic
acid is, in the true logic of chemistry, a simple
body, which becomes muriatic acid by its union with
hydrogen.</p>

<p>The new views arising out of such a revolution
in chemical opinion are certainly not the least important
of those to which the discoveries of Davy
have given birth. Dr. Johnson has remarked, that
"one of the most hazardous attempts of criticism is
to choose the best amongst many good." I am much
mistaken, however, if the chemists of Europe will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
not, without hesitation, pronounce his researches
into the nature of oxymuriatic acid, and its relations,
with the exception of those by which he
established the chemical laws of Voltaic action, to
be by far the most important of all his labours; not
only as evincing the ascendancy of his genius, and
the steadiness of his perseverance, but as marking a
new and splendid era in chemical science.</p>

<p>It is much more difficult to eradicate an ancient
error than to establish a new truth; and on this occasion,
he had not only to contend against the pampered
errors of a domineering system, but against
the equivocal and illusive evidence, or, if I may be
allowed the expression, the apparent neutrality of
facts by which the truth of his theory was to be
judged. In consequence of the constant and often
unsuspected interference of water, there is scarcely a
result connected with the chemical history of the
bodies in dispute, that did not admit of being
equally well explained upon the hypothesis that
oxymuriatic acid is a compound, as upon that of its
being a simple or undecompounded substance. The
question could never have been determined but by
an investigation of the most refined and subtile nature;
so delicately was the evidence balanced, that
nothing but the keenest eye, and the steadiest hand,
could have determined the side on which the beam
preponderated.</p>

<p>The illustrious discoverer of oxymuriatic acid
considered that body as muriatic acid freed from
hydrogen, or, in the obscure language of the Stahlian
school, as muriatic acid deprived of phlogiston,
whence he assigned to it the name of <em>dephlogisticated</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
muriatic acid. Upon the establishment of the antiphlogistic
theory by Lavoisier, it became essential
to the generalization which distinguished it, that a
body performing the functions of an acid, and above
all, supporting the process of combustion, should be
regarded as containing oxygen in its composition;
and facts were not wanting to sanction such an inference.
The substance could not even be produced
from muriatic acid, without the action of some body
known to contain oxygen; while the fact of such a
body becoming deoxidated by the process, seemed
to demonstrate, beyond the possibility of error, that
the conversion of the muriatic into the oxymuriatic
acid, was nothing more than a simple transference
of oxygen from the oxide to the acid: an opinion
which was universally adopted, and which for nearly
thirty years triumphed without opposition.</p>

<p>The body of evidence by which Davy overthrew
this doctrine, and established the undecompounded
nature of oxymuriatic acid, is to be found in a succession
of papers read before the Royal Society, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i>
in that already announced,&mdash;in his Bakerian Lecture
for 1810,&mdash;and in a subsequent memoir read in
February 1811.</p>

<p>It will be impossible for me to follow the author
through all the intricacies of the enquiry; but I
shall seize upon some of its more prominent points,
and give a general outline of its bearings.</p>

<p>No sooner had his suspicions been excited with
regard to the compound nature of oxymuriatic acid,
than it occurred to him that, if oxygen were really
present in that body, he might readily obtain it from
some of its compounds; that, for instance, its combination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
with tin would yield an oxide of that metal
by ammonia; while those with phosphorus would
furnish, on analysis, either the phosphor<em>ous</em>, or phosphor<em>ic</em>
acid. But after experiments in which the
presence of water was most cautiously excluded, the
results he had anticipated were not obtained. In
the place of an oxide of tin, the product, on the
application of heat, volatilized in dense and pungent
fumes; and, instead of obtaining an acid of phosphorus,
a body possessing new and unexpected properties
resulted. Again,&mdash;it had been stated, in
confirmation of the theory that recognised the presence
of oxygen in oxymuriatic acid, that when this
latter body and ammonia were made to act upon
each other, water was formed: our chemist frequently
repeated the experiment, and convinced
himself that such was not the fact.</p>

<p>It had been shown by Mr. Cruickshank, and more
recently proved by MM. Gay Lussac and Thénard,
that oxymuriatic acid and hydrogen, when mixed in
nearly equal proportions, produce a matter almost
entirely condensable by water, which is common
muriatic acid; and that water is not deposited in
the operation. Davy made many experiments on
the subject, and he found, that when these gases
were mingled together in equal volumes over water,
introduced into an exhausted vessel, and fired by the
electric spark, muriatic acid resulted, although, at
the same time, there was a certain degree of condensation,
and a slight deposition of vapour; but on
repeating the experiment in a manner still more
refined, and by carefully drying the gases, such
condensation became proportionally less.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
When, in addition to the above experimental evidence,
it is stated that MM. Gay Lussac and Thénard
had proved, by a copious collection of instances,
that in the usual cases where oxygen is eliminated
from oxymuriatic acid, water is always present, and
muriatic acid gas is formed; and as it has been
moreover shown that oxymuriatic is converted into
muriatic acid gas by combining with hydrogen, it is
scarcely possible to avoid the conclusion, that the
oxygen is derived from the decomposition of water,
and not from that of the acid.</p>

<p>When mercury is made to act, by means of Voltaic
electricity, upon one volume of muriatic acid
gas, all the acid disappears, calomel is formed, and
half a volume of hydrogen is evolved.</p>

<p>By such experiments and arguments, Davy was
led to the conclusion that, as yet, oxymuriatic acid
has not been decompounded; that it is a peculiar
body, elementary as far as our knowledge extends,
and analogous, in its tendency of combination with
inflammable matter, to oxygen gas; that, in fact,
it may be a <em>peculiar</em> acidifying and dissolving principle,
forming with different substances compounds
analogous to acids containing oxygen, or to oxides,
in their properties and powers of combination, but
differing from them in being, for the most part,
decomposable by water. On this idea, he thinks
that muriatic acid may be considered as having
hydrogen for its base, and oxymuriatic acid for
its acidifying principle. In confirmation of such
an opinion, it is also important to remark, that in
its electrical relations, oxymuriatic acid maintains
its analogy to oxygen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
The vivid combustion of bodies in oxymuriatic
acid gas, Davy acknowledges, may, at first view,
appear a reason why oxygen should be admitted as
one of its elements; but he answers this argument
by stating, that heat and light are merely results of
the intense agency of combination; and that sulphur
and metals, alkaline earths and acids, become alike
ignited under such circumstances.</p>

<p>As change of theory with regard to the primitive
must necessarily modify all our views with respect
to the nature of secondary bodies, so must this new
view of oxymuriatic acid affect all our opinions
respecting its compounds. Davy accordingly proceeded,
in the first place, to investigate the various
bodies which had been distinguished by the name of
<em>hyper-oxymuriates</em>, <em>muriates</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It also became necessary to alter the nomenclature,
since to call a body which neither contains
oxygen nor muriatic acid, by a term which denotes
the presence of both, is contrary to those very principles
which first suggested it. Having consulted
some of the most eminent philosophers, Davy proposed
a name founded upon one of the most obvious
and characteristic properties of the oxymuriatic acid,
namely, its colour, and called it <span class="smcap">Chlorine</span>.</p>

<p>If then oxymuriatic acid, or chlorine, does not
contain any oxygen, a question immediately arises
as to the true nature of those compounds in which
the muriatic acid has been supposed to exist in combination
with a much larger proportion of oxygen
than in the oxymuriatic acid,&mdash;in the state in which
it has been named by Mr. Chenevix <em>hyper-oxygenized</em>
muriatic acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
In his Bakerian Lecture of 1810, entitled, "On
some of the Combinations of Oxymuriatic Gas and
Oxygen, and on the Chemical Relations of these
Principles," he details a number of experiments for
the illustration of this subject, and arrives at the
conclusion, that the oxygen in the hyper-oxymuriate
of potash is in triple combination with the metal
and chlorine. He likewise confirms his views, with
regard to the elementary nature of this latter body,
by a series of new enquiries, and shows that they
are not incompatible with known phenomena:&mdash;for
instance, Scheele explained the bleaching powers of
oxymuriatic gas, by supposing that it destroyed
colours by combining with <em>Phlogiston</em>. Berthollet<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
considered it as acting by imparting oxygen; Davy
now proves that the pure gas is wholly incapable of
altering vegetable colours, and that its operation in
bleaching entirely depends upon its property of decomposing
water, and of thus liberating its oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
The experiment by which he demonstrated this fact
is so simple and satisfactory, that I shall here relate
it. Having filled a glass globe, containing dry
powdered muriate of lime, with oxymuriatic gas,
he introduced into another globe, also containing
muriate of lime, some dry paper tinged with litmus,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
that had been just heated; by which device the
intrusion of moisture was effectually prevented.
After some time, this latter globe was exhausted,
and then connected with that containing the oxymuriatic
gas, and by an appropriate set of stop-cocks,
the paper was exposed to the action of the
gas thus dried: no change of colour in the test
paper took place, and after two days, there was
scarcely a perceptible alteration; while some similar
paper dried and introduced into the gas, that had
not been exposed to muriate of lime, was instantly
bleached.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the eagerness with which he
seized upon facts, in order to apply them to economical
purposes, it may be stated that, on reflecting
upon the theory of bleaching, and on the changes
which its agents undergo, he was led to propose the
use of a liquor produced by the condensation of
oxymuriatic gas in water, containing magnesia diffused
through it, as superior to the oxymuriate of
lime commonly employed.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>It has been very truly observed, that all knowledge
which is gained tends towards the acquisition
of more, just as the iron dug from the mine facilitates
in return the working of the miner. Never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
was this truth more forcibly illustrated than by the
discovery of the nature of chlorine. In the progress
of that train of enquiry, which became necessary for
the adjustment of our views as they regarded the
combinations of that body, Davy discovered a series
of new compounds, the history of which he communicated
in successive papers to the Royal Society.</p>

<p>In a memoir read in February 1811, entitled,
"On a Combination of Oxymuriatic Gas and Oxygen
Gas," he announced the existence of a <em>protoxide</em>
of chlorine, under the name of <em>Euchlorine</em>; and in
a communication from Rome in the year 1815, he
described another compound of chlorine and oxygen,
containing a still larger proportion of this latter
element, and which has since been made the subject
of a series of experiments by Count Stadion of
Vienna. As it does not exhibit any acid properties,
Dr. Henry proposes to call it a <em>Peroxide</em>, in preference
to <em>Deutoxide</em>; thinking it probable that intermediate
compounds, between this and the protoxide
already mentioned, may be hereafter discovered.</p>

<p>His paper on <em>euchlorine</em> abounds with interest.
He found that by acting on the salts formerly denominated
<em>hyper-oxymuriates</em>, by muriatic acid, the
gas evolved differed very greatly in its properties,
with the different modes of preparing it. When
much acid was employed with a small quantity of
the salt, and the gas was collected over water, it
was not found to differ from oxymuriatic gas; but
when, on the other hand, the gas was procured by
means of a weak acid, and a considerable excess of
the salt, at a low heat, and was collected over mercury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
it possessed properties essentially different.
Its colour, under such circumstances, was of a dense
tint of brilliant yellow-green, whence the name of
<em>euchlorine</em>.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> When in a pure form, this gas is so
readily decomposed, that it will sometimes explode
during the time of its transfer from one vessel to
another, producing both heat and light with an
expansion of volume,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and it may always be made
to explode by a very gentle heat, often even by
that of the hand.</p>

<p>The results of its explosion indicate its composition
to be one atom of chlorine, and one of oxygen.
None of the metals that burn in chlorine act
upon this gas at common temperatures; but when
the oxygen is separated, they then inflame in the
residual chlorine. This fact Davy illustrated by a
series of experiments, one of which, from its extreme
beauty, I shall here relate. If a glass vessel,
containing copper-leaf, be exhausted, and the euchlorine
afterwards admitted, no action will take
place; but throw in a little nitrous gas, and a
rapid decomposition will ensue, and the metal will
burn with its accustomed brilliancy.</p>

<p>The discovery of this interesting gas, and that
of the facts connected with it, not only confirmed
the novel views with regard to the elementary nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
of chlorine, but they reconciled the contradictory
accounts of different authors respecting the
properties of that body.</p>

<p>The weak attraction subsisting between the elements
of this compound gas, which by a comparatively
low temperature are made repulsive of each
other, confirms also the supposition of Davy, that
oxygen and chlorine belong to the same class of
bodies.</p>

<p>The discovery of the <em>peroxide of chlorine</em> was
made during an examination of the action of acids
on the <em>hyper-oxymuriates</em> of Chenevix, undertaken
by Davy in consequence of a statement of M. Gay
Lussac, that a peculiar acid, which he called <em>chloric
acid</em>, might be procured from the <em>hyper-oxymuriate
of baryta</em> by sulphuric acid. With regard to this
acid, which its discoverer considered as composed
of one atom of chlorine and five atoms of oxygen,
Davy entered into a warm controversy, affirming
that the fluid in question owed its acid powers
to combined hydrogen; and that it was analogous
to the other hyper-oxymuriates, as being triple compounds
of inflammable bases with chlorine and oxygen,
in which the two former determine the character
of the compound: this opinion, however,
he afterwards abandoned, and I have reason to believe
that he regretted ever having advanced it.</p>

<p>Amidst these new views, it became necessary to
alter our opinions with regard to many of those
compounds which have been termed <em>muriates</em>, but
which, it would appear, contain neither muriatic
acid nor oxygen, but are, strictly speaking, combinations
of metals with chlorine, held in union
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
by a very powerful affinity, since chlorine is capable
of expelling the whole of the oxygen from any
metallic oxide, and of taking its place; even those
metals that are most distinguished by their affinity
for oxygen, abandon it whenever their oxides are
heated in chlorine, in which case oxygen gas is
disengaged.</p>

<p>The same metal is also capable of uniting with
different proportions of chlorine, which, so far as
has been yet ascertained, are definite, and in no case
exceed two proportions to one of metal. Hence it
was proposed by Davy, in fixing the nomenclature
of these compounds, to designate such as contain
the least proportion of chlorine by the termination
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ane</i>, added to the Latin name of the metal, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cuprane</i>
for that of copper; those containing the
larger proportion of chlorine, by the termination
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anea</i>, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cupranea</i>. The chemical name of our common
culinary salt, in conformity with such a nomenclature,
would be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sodane</i>. This proposition,
however, has not been adopted;<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> the compounds
of metals and chlorine are either called <em>chlorurets</em>,
or what is preferable, from their analogy with the
similar compounds of oxygen, <em>chlorides</em>, and which
are further distinguished as <em>protochlorides</em>, <em>deutochlorides</em>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>In connexion with the history of these chlorides,
a question arises of great interest and obscurity, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
which has engaged the attention of some of our
most distinguished chemists,&mdash;whether such a body,
when dissolved by water, remains as a chloride; or,
by decomposing that fluid, and combining with its
elements, is not immediately converted into a muriate?
With respect to several of these chlorides,
no doubt can be entertained as to the fact of their
decomposing water; for instance, the chloride of
phosphorus is thus acted upon, the oxygen of the
water forms phosphorous acid with the phosphorus,
while its hydrogen unites with the chlorine to form
muriatic acid; and as those products are such as do
not combine with each other, but exist in a state of
mixture in the water, each may be recognised by its
peculiar properties. In like manner, as Davy has
observed, when water is added in certain quantities
to Libavius's liquor (<em>deutochloride of tin</em>), a solid
crystalline mass is obtained, from which oxide of
tin and muriate of ammonia can be obtained by
ammonia.</p>

<p>In his Elements of Chemical Philosophy, Davy
has been, in many instances, explicit on this point;
and his opinions are favourable to the idea that
chlorides become muriates by being dissolved in
water: thus, he states that the perchloride of iron
"acts with violence upon water, and forms a solution
of red muriate of iron;" and he observes that
the permuriate "forms a solution of green muriate
of iron by its action upon water."<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> With regard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
however, to the general principle, that chlorides
become muriates by solution, there are difficulties
which do not fall within the province of a biographer
to discuss. I shall merely observe that such a
change is, in many cases, so inconsistent with our
preconceived opinions, that very strong evidence is
required to reconcile us to its truth. We are undoubtedly
prepared to hear that much may happen
between the cup and the lip,&mdash;but that common
salt should be a <em>chloride of sodium</em> on our plates, and
a <em>muriate of soda</em> in our mouths, is certainly a very
startling assertion.</p>

<p>The reception which the chloridic theory met
with from the chemical world might aptly enough
be adduced in illustration of that remark with
which I commenced the preceding chapter. At
first, its truth was questioned, and no sooner had
this been triumphantly established, than an attempt
was invidiously made to transfer the glory of the
discovery from Davy to the French philosophers.
Upon each of these points, I shall beg to offer a few
observations.</p>

<p>First, with regard to the fact of chlorine being
as yet an undecompounded body. The very announcement
of a theory so adverse to the universal
faith of Europe, was a signal for open hostilities;
the observations of Dr. Murray may be considered
as expressing the sentiments of most of the leading
chemists on the first publication of the novel views
of Davy. "Opinions," says he, "more unexpected
have seldom been announced to chemists, than those
lately advanced by Mr. Davy with regard to the
constitution of the muriatic and oxymuriatic acids;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> that the latter is not a compound of muriatic
acid and oxygen, but a simple substance, and that
the former is a compound of this substance with
hydrogen. The more general principle connected
with these opinions, that oxymuriatic acid is, like
oxygen, an acidifying element, forming with inflammables
and metals an extensive series of analogous
compounds, leads still more directly to the
subversion of the established chemical systems, and
to an entire revolution in some of the most important
doctrines of the science."</p>

<p>Dr. Murray entered the lists as the avowed partisan
of the theory of Berthollet; Dr. Davy, on the
other hand, appeared as the champion of his brother's
doctrine. A severe contest ensued, and both
combatants displayed equal skill and strength. The
object of the former was to demonstrate the presence
of water, or its elements, as a constituent part
of muriatic acid; and he proposed to determine the
point by combining the dry gases of muriatic acid
and ammonia; for as these bodies did not contain
its elements, should water appear, he maintained
that it must be considered as pre-existing in the
muriatic acid; while, on the contrary, if no water
could be procured, it would be unphilosophical to
suppose it present, but that muriatic acid gas must,
in that case, be considered as a compound of hydrogen
and chlorine. In performing this experiment,
Dr. Murray did succeed in obtaining a portion of
water; but the inference from such a fact was questioned
on the other side, upon the assumption of the
humidity of the gases. As all parties, however,
seemed to agree, that if every source of error could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
be excluded, the combination of these gases would
furnish an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum crucis</i>, by which the truth
or fallacy of either theory might be established,
Davy, when at Edinburgh, was desirous of repeating
the experiment with Dr. Hope, and it was accordingly
made in the College Laboratory. Sir
George Mackenzie, Mr. Playfair, and some other
gentlemen, were present. The results were communicated
in Nicholson's Journal by Dr. Davy, and
may be briefly stated as follows:&mdash;The alkaline and
acid gases were pure, and both had been previously
dried by exposure for sixteen hours to substances
having a strong attraction for water. The apparatus
consisted of a plain retort of about the capacity
of twenty-six cubic inch measures, with a stop-cock;
and of a receiver, with a suitable stop-cock. The
latter was filled over mercury with one of the gases,
which from the receiver passed into the exhausted
retort by means of the stop-cocks; the other gas
was introduced the same way into the retort; and
thus alternately about ninety cubic inches of each
gas were combined. All the salt having then been
driven into the bulb of the retort by the heat of a
spirit lamp, the neck was cooled and kept cold by
moistened cloths, whilst the bulb was heated by a
coke fire, till the muriate began to sublime, and to
make its appearance at the curvature of the vessel
when the fire was withdrawn. The result was then
examined, while the bottom of the retort was still
very hot: a dew, just perceptible, was observed
lining the cold neck. The quantity of water was so
extremely small, that the globular particles composing
this dew could scarcely be perceived by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
naked eye; now the quantity of water, according to
hypothesis, should equal no less than eight grains.
There is no small difference, it must be confessed,
between that quantity and a dew barely perceptible,
and which may reasonably be referred to a minute
quantity of vapour in the gases, or to a little moisture
derived from the mercury, a small quantity of
which entered the retort with the gases. Dr. Hope
wished to ascertain how much water would produce
such a dew as was observed. For this purpose he
heated in a retort, of a similar size to that used in
the experiment, a single drop of water, which it
may be said weighs about a grain. The appearance
of condensed water, in this instance, in the neck of
the retort, was much greater than in the preceding:
he considered it as being three or four times as
great.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>From these results it may be concluded, on Dr.
Murray's own ground of reasoning, that water is not
a constituent part of muriatic acid gas, and that
this substance is a compound merely of chlorine and
hydrogen; for it is easy to account for the presence
of about one-third of a grain of water from various
sources, while it is impossible to account for the
absence of eight grains upon any theory except that
which supposes the gas to be <em>anhydrous</em>.</p>

<p>I shall not pursue the numerous other experiments
by which it was attempted to prove the fallacy
of Davy's views; they all turn upon the same
point, and were refuted by the same vigorous methods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
of enquiry. The chloridic theory may therefore
now be considered as fully established: the philosophers
who were for so long a period hostile to
its reception, have at length yielded their assent;
and Berzelius, in a paper published in the "Annales
de Chimie," on the subject of sulpho-cyanic acid,
has unconditionally tendered his allegiance; while
the subsequent discovery of iodine and bromine has
confirmed, by the most beautiful analogies, the
views so satisfactorily explained by experiment.</p>

<p>As to the claim of priority which has been urged
by several philosophers in favour of the French
chemists, Davy, in speaking of Gay Lussac's paper,
published in the "Annales de Chimie" for July
1814, observes, that "the historical notes attached
to it are of a nature not to be passed over without
animadversion. M. Gay Lussac states, that he and
M. Thénard were the first to advance the hypothesis
that chlorine was a simple body; and he quotes
M. Ampère as having entertained that opinion
before me. On the subject of the originality of the
idea of chlorine being a simple body, I have always
vindicated the claims of Scheele; but I must assume
for myself the labour of having demonstrated
its properties and combinations, and of having explained
the chemical phenomena it produces; and I
am in possession of a letter from M. Ampère, that
shows he has no claims of this kind to make."<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The question of priority appears to me to be readily
settled by a reference to printed documents.
Davy published his "Elements of Chemical Philosophy"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
in 1812, containing a systematic account of
his new doctrines concerning the combinations of
simple bodies. Chlorine is there placed in the same
rank with oxygen, and finally removed from the
class of acids. In 1813, M. Thénard published the
first volume of his "Traité de Chimie Elémentaire
Théorique et Pratique," in which he states the composition
of oxymuriatic acid as follows:&mdash;"<em>Composition</em>.
The oxygenated muriatic gas contains the
half of its volume of oxygen gas, not including that
which we may suppose in muriatic acid." It was
not until the year 1816, that, by a note in his fourth
volume, he appears to have at all relaxed in his
attachment to the old theory of Lavoisier and Berthollet;
and it will presently appear, that at the
period above mentioned, iodine had been discovered,
and its analogies to chlorine fully established, by the
sagacity of Davy.</p>

<p>Having, as I trust, offered an impartial view of
his claims to the establishment of the chloridic
theory, I shall resume my narrative of those events
which more immediately connect themselves with
his personal history at this period.</p>

<p>The great fame of Davy, and the high importance
of the discoveries which had bestowed it, became
a general theme of admiration throughout the
scientific circles of Europe, and induced the members
of the Dublin Society to invite him to that
city, for the purpose of delivering a course of lectures.
From the authentic documents which have
been placed in my hands, I am enabled to give a
particular account of this transaction.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Dublin Society held on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
3rd of May 1810, the following Resolutions were
proposed and unanimously carried, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i></p>

<p>1. "That it is the wish of the Society to communicate
to the Irish public, in the most extended
manner consistent with the other engagements of
the Society, the knowledge of a Science so intimately
connected with the improvement of Agriculture and
the Arts, which it is their great object to promote;
and that, with this view, it appears to them extremely
desirable to obtain the fullest information
respecting the recent discoveries made by Mr. Davy,
in Electro-chemical science.</p>

<p>2. "Resolved, That application be made to the
Royal Society, requesting that they will be pleased
to dispense with the engagements of Mr. Davy, so
far as to allow the Dublin Society to solicit the
favour of his delivering a course of Electro-chemical
Lectures in their new Laboratory, as soon as may be
convenient after their present course of chemical
lectures shall have been completed by their Professor
Mr. Higgins.</p>

<p>3. "That the sum of four hundred guineas be
appropriated out of the funds of the Society, to be
presented to Mr. Davy, as a remuneration for the
trouble and expense which they propose he should
incur, and as a mark of the importance they attach
to the communication which they solicit."</p>

<p>Mr. Leslie Foster having stated to the Dublin
Society that the "Farming Society of Ireland" were
desirous of availing themselves of this opportunity
to apply to Mr. Davy to repeat before them the six
lectures on the application of chemistry to agriculture,
which he delivered this year (1810) to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Board of Agriculture in England, and that they
requested the Dublin Society would accommodate
them with the use of their Laboratory for that purpose,
all the members of the Dublin Society having
free admission to such lectures&mdash;</p>

<p>The following Resolutions were passed by the
Dublin Society:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That in the event of Mr. Davy coming over to
Ireland, and consenting to deliver the Course referred
to, the Farming Society shall be accommodated
with the use of the Laboratory, according to their
request.</p>

<p>"That it be referred to the Committee of Economy
to consider on what terms, and under what
regulations, it may be expedient to issue tickets of
admission to the Electro-chemical Course, so as to
reimburse to the Society the expenses attendant on
the arrangement; and that, in order to give the
fullest effect to such regulations, the members of the
Society renounce any claim to gratuitous admission
to this course."</p>

<p>A letter having been addressed to Mr. Davy by
the Secretary of the Society, inviting him to Dublin,
for the purpose of delivering courses of lectures,
in conformity with the foregoing resolutions, the
following answer was received from him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO JOHN LESLIE FOSTER, ESQ. M. P. SECRETARY<br />
TO THE DUBLIN SOCIETY.</p>

<p class="date"> May 30, 1810.</p>

<p class="opening">SIR,</p>

<p>I had the honour of communicating your letter
to the President and Council of the Royal Society,
who have desired me to express to you, Sir, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
through you, to the Dublin Society, the lively interest
they feel in the prosperity of that useful
public body, and the desire that they have to promote
its important object.</p>

<p>On these grounds, they have been pleased to
permit me to be absent from the meetings of the
Royal Society, during the period that may be necessary
for delivering a Course of Lectures at the
Laboratory of the Dublin Society, in the month of
November next.</p>

<p>Be pleased to express to the Dublin Society my
grateful acknowledgments for the honour they have
done me in making such a proposition; and assure
them that I shall use my best exertions to promote
their views for the extension of Chemical Science,
and every other species of useful knowledge.</p>

<p>I beg to be permitted to thank you, Sir, for the
flattering manner in which you had the goodness
to convey to me their proposal.</p>

<p class="signature2">I am, Sir, with great respect,<br />
<span class="j1">Your obliged and obedient servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap j8">H. Davy, Sec. R. S.</span></p>
</div>

<p>On the commencement of the Course, on the 8th
of November 1810, three hundred and seventy-one
admission tickets had been issued; and the Committee
of Chemistry having expressed their opinion
to the Society, that the lecture-room would not
afford accommodation for a greater number of persons,
the Assistant Secretary was directed to limit
his tickets to that number. On the 15th instant,
however, the number was increased to four hundred,
without inconvenience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
At the close of the Course, on the 29th of November,
the Dublin Society passed the following
Resolutions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Resolved, That the thanks of the Society be
communicated to Mr. Davy for the excellent Course
of Lectures which, at their request, has been delivered
by him in their Laboratory; and to assure
him that the views which led the Society to seek
for these communications, have been answered even
beyond their hopes;&mdash;that the manner in which he
has unfolded his discoveries has not merely imparted
new and valuable information, but further appears
to have given a direction of the public mind towards
Chemical and Philosophical enquiries, which cannot
fail in its consequences to produce the improvement
of the Sciences, Arts, and Manufactures in Ireland.</p>

<p>"That the thanks of the Society be communicated
to the Royal Society for their ready compliance
with our request, in dispensing with the engagements
of Mr. Davy, during the last six weeks.</p>

<p>"That Mr. Davy be requested to accept the sum
of five hundred guineas from the Society."<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The following letter appears, from the date, to
have been written about a week before his arrival in
Dublin.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">October 12, 1810.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>Upon every occasion your recommendation, or
opinion, would have great weight with me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Amongst the candidates for the office of Clerk to
the Royal Society, there is one Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, that I
am well acquainted with, and who was formerly attached
to the Royal Institution. He appears to me,
as well from his scientific character, as from his habits
and pursuits, to be admirably fitted for the
situation. I advised him nearly two months ago,
in consequence of a conversation with Sir Joseph
Banks, to offer himself for the situation. I cannot
therefore interest myself for any other person who
does not possess superior qualifications.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph's maxim, which I hope will be adopted
by all the members, is&mdash;"let it be given to the most
worthy." I have no doubt that Mr.&mdash;&mdash; would
fill the situation with credit, and that he is a very
worthy man; but, from all that I can learn, his
claims are much inferior to those of W&mdash;&mdash;. We
want not merely a civil, gentlemanlike, honest man,
but a man a little accustomed to calculation, to astronomical
observation, and to experiment.</p>

<p>I am in a delightful country here&mdash;the Valley of
the Tyne&mdash;enjoying a few days' leisure after a rather
hard chemical campaign, and preparing health and
spirits for another in Ireland, where I am going
next week.</p>

<p>I hope to be in London by the first week in December.
I intend next summer to go into Cornwall&mdash;God
willing; and I will not go through without
seeing you, and telling you that, under all circumstances,
I shall always think of you with the warmest
esteem, and shall always be</p>

<p class="signature">Your sincere friend,<br />
<span class="smcap j4">H. Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
In the following year, Davy was again solicited
by the Dublin Society to deliver lectures in their
laboratory; and at a meeting of the members on the
13th of June 1811, a series of resolutions were
passed, by which he was empowered to procure
copies of many of the geological sketches referred to
in a course of lectures he had delivered on Geology
at the Royal Institution; and also to superintend
the construction of a large Voltaic battery, for the
illustration of the proposed lectures.</p>

<p>In compliance with this request, Davy delivered
two distinct courses; one on the Elements of Chemical
Philosophy, the other on Geology, for which
he received the unanimous thanks of the Society,
and as a more substantial testimony of their gratitude,
the sum<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> of seven hundred and fifty pounds;
the receipt of which Davy acknowledged by the
following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO B. MAC CARTHY, ESQ. ASSISTANT SECRETARY<br />
TO THE DUBLIN SOCIETY.</p>

<p class="date">Dublin, December 9, 1811.</p>

<p class="opening">SIR,</p>

<p>I have received your letter, inclosing a draught
for seven hundred and fifty pounds Irish.</p>

<p>I am very much gratified by the thanks of the
Dublin Society, for the courses of lectures which I
had the honour of delivering in their laboratory; and
I am proud of their opinion, that they will be useful
to the Irish public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
The attention, candour, and indulgence with
which they were received by the audience, I shall
remember with the warmest feelings of gratitude as
long as I live.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, Sir, with much esteem,
your obliged and obedient servant,</p>

<p class="smcap signature">H. Davy.</p>
</div>

<p>Before he quitted Dublin, the Provost and Fellows
of Trinity College conferred upon him the
honorary degree of LL.D., as an expression of the
high admiration which his eminent scientific merits
had so universally commanded.</p>

<p>In the month of August, in the same year, his
opinion was requested by a committee, as to the
best method to be adopted for ventilating the House
of Lords; to which circumstance he alludes in the
following note to his friend Mr. Pepys.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="date">August 10, 1811.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR PEPYS,</p>

<p>I find that I am engaged on Wednesday, to
meet Lord Liverpool, at the House of Lords, to
consider a mode of ventilating it.</p>

<p>This business, most unluckily, will prevent my
accompanying you; but I shall be glad to go with
you on some other day, and to touch up the trout at
Cheynies, and afterwards to proceed to Serge Hill.</p>

<p class="signature">Very affectionately yours,<br />
<span class="smcap j6">H. Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>This undertaking, it must be allowed, was on
Davy's part a most complete failure: whether he
had miscalculated the diameter and number of the
apertures necessary for establishing a current, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
difficult to say, but it was obvious that the stream
of fresh air thus introduced was by no means adequate
to the demand for it.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The failure, so vexatious to Davy, became to
others a fertile source of pleasantry, and numerous
epigrams, not exactly of a character to meet the
public eye, were very generally circulated, and
which, in recording the miscarriage of science, displayed
the triumph of wit.</p>

<p>The scientific renown of Davy having attracted
the attention of his late Majesty, at that time Prince
Regent, he received from his Royal Highness the
honour of Knighthood, at a levee held at Carlton
House, on Wednesday, the 8th of April 1812; and
it may be remarked, that he was the first person
on whom that honour had been conferred by the
Regent.</p>

<p>On the day following this occurrence, Sir Humphry
delivered his farewell lecture before the members
of the Royal Institution; for he was on the eve
of assuming a new station in society, which induced
him to retire from those public situations which he
had long held with so much advantage to the world,
and with so much honour to himself. How far
such a measure was calculated to increase his happiness
I shall not enquire; but I am bound to observe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
that it was not connected with any desire to abandon
the pursuit of science, nor even to relax in his
accustomed exertions to promote its interests. It
was evident, however, to his friends, that other
views of ambition than those presented by achievements
in science, had opened upon his mind: the
wealth he was about to command might extend the
sphere of his usefulness, and exalt him in the scale
of society: his feelings became more aristocratic, he
discovered charms in rank which had before escaped
him, and he no longer viewed Patrician distinction
with philosophic indifference.</p>

<p>On the 11th of April 1812, Sir Humphry married
Mrs. Apreece, the widow of Shuckburgh Ashby
Apreece, Esq. eldest son of Sir Thomas Apreece:
this lady was the daughter and heiress of Charles
Kerr, of Kelso, Esq. and possessed a very considerable
fortune.</p>

<p>Immediately after the celebration of the marriage,
Sir Humphry and his bride proceeded to the hospitable
mansion of Sir John Sebright, and afterwards
made a tour through Scotland, receiving wherever
they went the most flattering marks of attention.</p>

<p>During their excursion, Davy wrote various letters
to his scientific friends, several of which I shall
introduce; but, in order that those to Mr. Children
may be understood, it will be necessary that the
reader should be made acquainted with a transaction
which occurred in the year 1811.</p>

<p>In consequence of some conversation on gunpowder,
during which Davy observed that its composition
might be greatly improved by rendering it less
<em>hygrometric</em>, a proposition was started, that he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
join Mr. Children and Mr. Burton in establishing
a manufactory for its preparation upon chemical
principles. Whether Davy considered himself, in the
strict commercial sense, a partner, or merely a chemical
adviser, it is perhaps not easy to determine;
but it is quite clear that both Mr. Children and Mr.
Burton considered him in the former light, although
it is an act of justice to those gentlemen to state,
that the very moment Davy expressed his disinclination
to such an arrangement, they immediately,
without the slightest hesitation, released him from
all responsibility. This I am enabled to assert, after
a most careful investigation of all the correspondence
that passed upon the occasion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO JOHN GEORGE CHILDREN, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Harewood House, July 14, 1812.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>I am very sorry that I missed you the day before
I set out on my journey. You will have learnt
from your solicitor that I signed the articles. I
still think I shall return before any powder will
be made, at least if you do not make it till December,
for our present intention is to be in town
early in that month.</p>

<p>I sent to you an imperfect copy of my book,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
in which there were no engravings, and in which
one cancel was not inserted, thinking that you
would prefer a copy sent in that way: the cancelled
leaf, which you have not, contains a correction
for the quantity of nitrous acid gas and water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
to form the crystalline compound, which is the
base of oil of vitriol. Three parts nitrous acid
gas condense four parts sulphurous gas.</p>

<p>I have my little apparatus, which will enable me
to pursue my experiments on gunpowder. There
is one conclusion very obvious resulting from the
new facts,&mdash;a <em>perfect</em> gunpowder ought to contain
no more charcoal than is necessary to convert
the oxygen of the nitre into carbonic acid. Sulphur
forms from nitre just as much elastic fluid
as charcoal, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> if similar quantities of nitre be
entirely decomposed, one by charcoal, and one by
sulphur, and if the sulphurous gas and the carbonic
acid gas be compared, their volumes will be
equal. The advantage of forming carbonic acid
gas is, that it is more readily disengaged from the
alkali. Now it is a question, whether sulphur will
decompose <em>sulphate</em> of potash,&mdash;it will decompose
the carbonate; of this we are sure.</p>

<p>There ought, then, to be just as much sulphur
as will form sulphuret of potash with the potash:
191 of nitre, 28·5 of charcoal, and 30 of sulphur,
are the true proportions for forming nothing but
sulphuret of potash and elastic matter.</p>

<p>Pray send me some cards to circulate; address
to me, Post Office, Edinburgh. I hope you got
Cavendish's balance.</p>

<p>I have been here for two days:&mdash;it is a very magnificent

to you and to Mrs. Purkis, on my return.</p>

<p>We have had a delightful tour through the Highlands.
We are at the extreme point of our journey.
The pleasures of a refined society&mdash;that of Lord
and Lady Stafford's family&mdash;have induced us to
make a long pause here. We think we shall be in
London the beginning of December.</p>

<p>I have spent some days such as we passed together
in Wales. We have had all the varieties of
river, mountain, and wood scenery. The Lakes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
Scotland are infinitely finer than those of Wales;
but the glens of the Principality may fairly stand
in competition with those of the Highlands.</p>

<p>I hope I shall find you and your family in good
health, and that you will have spent a very pleasant
summer. I am, my dear Purkis,</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>I have received your two kind letters. I hope
your quiet life, and reasonable medical discipline,
will entirely restore your health.</p>

<p>We are now on our return, and probably shall
arrive in London before the middle of November:
our time, however, is uncertain, as the Election may
hasten, or keep us back for want of horses.</p>

<p>I can do nothing respecting the licence till my
return; I will then see Mr. Wharton, or Mr. Vansittart.
I have another subject of conversation in
which they are interested, and I can easily introduce
that of gunpowder.</p>

<p>I have been tolerably successful as a shot lately.
I have not fished. My last adventure was at the
Spey, near Gordon Castle, where I killed some noble
salmon. At Blair Athol I shot some ptarmigans
and a stag. I am now at Dunkeld, which I think
the most beautiful habitable spot in the Highlands.
The Tay, a noble river, rolls with a majestic stream
through lofty woods seated upon cliffs and rounded
hills; and in the background are the Mountains of
Benyglor and the hills of Killycrankie.</p>

<p>I have received a very interesting letter from
Ampère. He says that a combination of chlorine
and azote has been discovered at Paris, which is a
fluid, and explodes by the heat of the hand; the
discovery of which cost an eye and a finger to the
author. He gives no details as to the mode of combining
them. I have tried in my little apparatus

without success.</p>

<p>There is little doing here ... dresses

<p class="opening">MY DEAR CHILDREN,</p>

<p>I have just seen Pepys, and rejoice that he gives
me so good an account of your health. My wife is
much better, except that she has a swollen foot. I
have never seen her in such good health and spirits.
She is resolved to lead a home life of perfect quiet
for six weeks, and I fear you will not be able to
tempt her to quit her fire-side, though there is no
visit she would make with greater pleasure: but
lameness does not suit the country; and for one so
enthusiastically fond of nature, it would be vexatious
to be in the country, and not to be able to
enjoy hills, and meads, and woods.</p>

<p>But I am ready to come to my business whenever
you think I can be useful. I shall set to work to
make gunpowder with as much ardour as Miles
Peter&mdash;I hope with similar results.</p>

<p>I shall not be able to endure a very long separation
from my wife, but for three or four days I am
at your command.</p>

<p>I have been working yesterday and to-day on
some new objects; and we are to have a meeting
on Wednesday, at one o'clock, at the Institution,
to try to make this compound of azote and chlorine,

(Angling Chemists) propose a dinner at Brunet's.
If you can come to town on that day, I will promise

<p>The "Elements of Chemical Philosophy," a work
to which he has alluded in several of the preceding
letters, was published in June 1812. It is dedicated
to Lady Davy, to whom he offers it "as a pledge
that he shall continue to pursue Science with unabated
ardour."</p>

<p>This work, although only a small part of the
great labour he proposed to accomplish, must be
considered as one of high importance to the cause
of science. It has not perhaps announced any discoveries
which had not been previously communicated
to the Royal Society, but it has brought
together his original results, and arranged them in
one simple and digested plan&mdash;it has given coherence
to disjointed facts, and has exhibited their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
mutual bearings upon each other, and their general
relations to previously established truths.</p>

<p>Very shortly after the publication of this first
part, it was asserted by a scientific critic that the
work could never be completed upon the plan on
which it had commenced, which was little less than
a system of chemistry, in which all the facts were
to be verified by the author: an undertaking far
too gigantic for the most intrepid and laborious experimentalist
to accomplish. There was too much
truth in the remark:&mdash;the life of the Author has
closed&mdash;the work remains unfinished.</p>

<p>Although it bears the title of "Elements," its
plan and execution are rather adapted for the adept
than the Tyro in science; it has, however, enabled
the discoverer to expand several of his opinions with
a freedom which is not consistent with the studied
compression and elaborate brevity that necessarily
characterise the style of a Philosophical Memoir,&mdash;and
thus far it may have served the more humble
labourer.</p>

<p>The first impression which this volume must produce,
is that of admiration at the rapid and triumphant
progress of Chemistry, during the period
of a very few years; while a comparison of this
work with others, even of very recent date, will
show how much we are indebted for this progress
to the unrivalled labours of Davy.</p>

<p>The first part of his projected system, which constitutes
the volume under review, extends only to
the general laws of chemical changes, and to the
primary combinations of undecompounded bodies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
It is resolved into seven divisions, upon each of
which I propose to offer some remarks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First Division</span> embraces the consideration
of the three different forms of matter, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> Solidity,
Liquidity, and elastic Fluidity; and that of
the active powers on which they depend, and by
which they are changed, such as Gravitation, Cohesion,
Calorific repulsion, or Heat, and Attractions
chemical and electrical;&mdash;the laws of which
he has expounded in a lucid and masterly manner;
although it will be only necessary to quote the
following passage, to show that the greatest philosopher
may occasionally slide into error. "In
solids, the attractive force predominates over the
repulsive; in fluids, and in elastic fluids, they may
be regarded as in different states of equilibrium;
and in ethereal substances, the repulsive must be
considered as predominating over and destroying
the attractive force." A reviewer has very justly
observed, that it is difficult to conceive how so much
error and confusion could have been collected, by
such an author, into so short a sentence. It is a
solecism to say that two forces may exist in different
states of equilibrium; besides, it is generally
admitted that the repulsive force alone exists in
elastic fluids, and that it is only compensated by
external pressure, or gravitation.</p>

<p>In treating the subject of Heat, he maintains the
same opinion, though in a manner somewhat more
subdued, as that which he had formed at the very
commencement of his scientific career,<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>&mdash;that it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
nothing else than motion, and that the laws of Heat
are the same as the laws of Motion.</p>

<p>In taking a general view of the subject of Chemical
Attraction, there is a remarkable clearness
in his enunciation of its several propositions, and
a great felicity in the selection of its illustrations.
He combats the theory of Berthollet, respecting
the influence of mass, with singular success, and
confirms the general law, that all bodies combine
chemically, in certain definite proportions to be
expressed by numbers; so that, if one number be
employed to denote the smallest quantity in which
a body combines, all other quantities of the same
body will be as multiples of this number; and the
smallest proportions in which the undecompounded
substances enter into union being known, the constitution
of the compound they form may be learnt;
and the element which unites chemically in the
smallest quantity being expressed by unity, all the
other elements may be represented by the relations
of their quantities to unity. Unfortunately, however,
there has existed amongst philosophers a want
of agreement as to the <em>unit</em> to which the relative
values of the other numbers shall be referred. Mr.
Dalton selected Hydrogen as the unit; Davy followed
his example, but doubled the weight of
oxygen; while Wollaston, Thompson, and Berzelius,
have proposed oxygen as the most convenient
unit, since that element enters into the greatest
number of combinations.</p>

<p>To Dalton is now universally conceded the glory
of having established the laws of definite proportions;
but in unfolding them, he has employed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
expressions which involve speculations as to their
physical cause, and has thus given to that, which
is nothing more than a copious collection of facts,
the appearance of a refined theory. It may be
perfectly true, as Mr. Dalton supposes, that all
bodies are composed of ultimate atoms; but in the
present state of our knowledge, we can neither form
any idea of the nature of such atoms, nor of the
manner in which they may be grouped together.
We are therefore indebted to Davy for having,
by his early and powerful example, taught the chemist
how to disentangle fact from hypothesis, and
to investigate the doctrine of proportionals, without
any reference to the <em>atomic</em> theory which has been
proposed for its explanation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Second Division</span> treats of Radiant or
Ethereal Matter, and of its effects in producing
vision, heat, and chemical changes. It contains
some refined speculations respecting the possible
conversion of terrestrial bodies into light and heat,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Third Division</span> presents us with an account
of "Empyreal undecompounded Substances,"
or those which support combustion; together with
that of the compounds which they form with each
other. Upon this occasion, Davy has completely
rescued us from the trammels of the Anti-phlogistic
theory, and has shown that, so far from the process
of combustion depending upon the position or transfer
of oxygen, it is a <em>general</em> result of the actions of
<em>any</em> substances possessed of strong chemical attractions,
or different electrical relations, and that it
takes place in all cases in which an intense and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
violent motion can be conceived to be communicated
to the corpuscules of bodies, without any regard
to the peculiar nature of the substances engaged.
The announcement of the general law is
followed by a history of the only two undecompounded
bodies included under this arrangement,
viz. <em>Oxygen</em>, and <em>Chlorine</em>.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> In naming a class of
bodies by their relations to combustion, he distinctly
states that he merely intends to signify that the
production of heat and light is more characteristic
of their actions, than of those of any other substances;
and that they are, at the same time, opposed
to all other undecompounded substances by
their electrical relations, being always in Voltaic
combinations attracted to, or elicited from the positive
surface; whereas all other known undecompounded
substances are separated at the negative
surface.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fourth Division</span> comprises the history
of Undecompounded Inflammables, or Acidiferous
Substances, not Metallic, and that of their binary
combinations with oxygen and chlorine, or with
each other.</p>

<p>The bodies considered under this division, are
the following:&mdash;Hydrogen, Azote, Sulphur, Phosphorus,
and Boracium, or Boron. Under the history
of Sulphur, he gives us the true theory of the process
by which sulphuric acid is produced by the
combustion of that body in mixture with nitre, and
which had never before been explained in any
chemical work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The Fifth Division</span> contains the Metals; their
primary combinations with other undecompounded
bodies, and with each other.</p>

<p>In the order of classification adopted on this occasion,
the newly discovered inflammable metals,
producing by combustion alkalies, alkaline earths,
and earths, commence the series; next come those
which produce oxides; and lastly, those which produce
acids. Thus are we presented with a chain
of gradations of resemblance which may be traced
throughout the whole series of metallic bodies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sixth Division</span> comprehends certain bodies
(the <em>Fluoric Principle</em>, and the <em>Ammoniacal Amalgam</em>)
which present some extraordinary and anomalous
results. It is worthy of remark, that, at the
period at which this work was written, Davy considered
the peculiar acid developed from fluor spar,
by the action of sulphuric acid, as a compound of an
acid unknown in a separate state, and water; whence
he proposed to call it <em>Hydro-fluoric</em> acid,&mdash;a term
extremely objectionable from its ambiguity, since it
would indicate either hydrogen or water as one of
its constituents. At the conclusion, however, of
this chapter, in consequence of having observed certain
phenomena displayed by this gas, when in combination
with silica and boracic acid, he for a moment
seems to have caught the truth, but it as
quickly eluded his grasp, and he dismisses the conjecture
which it was his good fortune some years
afterwards to verify, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> that the fluoric acid is a
compound of an unknown principle, analogous to
chlorine, with hydrogen and water, and that <em>fluor
spar</em> is a compound of the same principle with
calcium, or the base of lime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
<span class="smcap">The Seventh Division</span> offers to the chemical
enquirer various speculations, as to the probable nature
of certain bodies hitherto undecompounded.
He observes, that "we know nothing of the true
elements belonging to nature; but as far as we can
reason from the relations of the properties of matter,
that hydrogen is the substance which approaches
nearest to what the elements may be supposed to be.
It has energetic powers of combination, its parts are
highly repulsive of each other, and attractive of the
particles of other matter; it enters into combination
in a quantity very much smaller than any other
substance, and in this respect it is approached by no
known body. After hydrogen, oxygen perhaps
partakes most of the elementary character: it has a
greater energy of attraction, and, with the exception
just stated, enters into combination in the smallest
proportion."</p>

<p>In conclusion, he hints at the possibility of the
same ponderable matter in different electrical states,
or in different arrangements, constituting substances
chemically different, and he thinks that there are
parallel cases in the different states in which bodies
are found connected with their different relations to
temperature: thus, steam, ice, and water, are the
same ponderable matter; and certain quantities of
steam and ice mixed together produce ice-cold water.</p>

<p>"That the forms of natural bodies may depend
upon different arrangements of the same particles of
matter, has been a favourite hypothesis, advanced in
the earliest era of physical research, and often supported
by the reasonings of the ablest philosophers.
This sublime chemical speculation, sanctioned by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
authority of Hooke, Newton, and Boscovich, must
not be confounded with the ideas advanced by the
alchemists, concerning the convertibility of the elements
into each other. The possible transmutation
of metals has generally been reasoned upon, not as a
philosophical research, but as an empirical process.
Those who have asserted the actual production of
the precious metals, or their decomposition, or who
have defended the chimera of the philosopher's stone,
have been either impostors, or men deluded by impostors.
In this age of rational enquiry, it will be
useless to decry the practices of the adepts, or to
caution the public against confounding the hypothetical
views respecting the elements founded upon
distinct analogies, with the dreams of alchemical
visionaries, most of whom, as an author of the last
century justly observed, professed an art without
principles, the beginning of which was deceit, and
the end poverty."</p>

<p>On the 18th of June 1812, Davy presented to the
Royal Society a paper entitled "On some Combinations
of Phosphorus and Sulphur; and on some
other subjects of Chemical Inquiry."</p>

<p>By the researches detailed in this Memoir, he
accomplished three important objects: he established
the existence of some new compounds&mdash;furnished
additional evidence in support of the doctrine of
definite proportions&mdash;and ascertained that most of
the substances obtained from aqueous solutions by
precipitation, are compounds of water, or <em>Hydrats</em>.
In the first place, he recognised the formation of
two distinct compounds of phosphorus and chlorine:
one, solid, white, and crystalline in its appearance;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
the other, fluid, limpid as water, and volatile. The
latter body he found to contain just double as much
chlorine as the former.</p>

<p>On experimenting upon this latter body with
water, he obtained a crystallized substance which he
proposed to call <em>Hydro-phosphorous acid</em>, since it
consists of pure phosphorous acid and water. By
decomposition in close vessels, it is resolved into
phosphoric acid, and a peculiar gas, consisting of one
proportional of phosphorus and four of hydrogen,
and for which he proposed the term <em>Hydro-phosphorous</em>
gas. The reader, no doubt, will be immediately
struck with the impropriety of a nomenclature
in which the prefix <em>Hydro</em> is made to
express water in the former, and hydrogen in the
latter instance.</p>

<p>In examining the results of the mutual decomposition
of water and the phosphoric compounds of
chlorine, Davy remarks, that it is scarcely possible
to imagine more perfect demonstrations of the laws
of definite combination: no products are formed
except the new combinations, (phosphoric acid from
the solid, phosphor<i>ous</i> acid, from the liquid compound,
and in both muriatic acid;) neither oxygen,
hydrogen, chlorine, nor phosphorus, is disengaged;
and therefore the ratio in which any two of them
combine being known, the ratio in which the rest
combine, in these cases, may be determined by calculation.</p>

<p>Lastly, he ascertained that most of the substances
obtained by precipitation from aqueous solutions are
compounds of water: thus zircona, magnesia, and
silica, when precipitated and dried at 212°, still contain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
definite proportions of water; and many of the
substances which had been considered as metallic
oxides, he found, when obtained from solutions, to
agree in this respect; and that their colours and
other properties are materially influenced by this
combined water.</p>

<p>On the 5th of November 1812, was read before
the Royal Society a letter addressed by Davy to
Sir Joseph Banks, on the subject of the detonating
compound already alluded to in his communications
to Mr. Children. He expresses his anxiety to have
the circumstances made public as speedily as possible,
since experiments upon the substance may be
connected with very dangerous results.</p>

<p>He had some time before received information
from Paris of a combination having been effected
between chlorine and azote, and that it was distinguished
by detonating properties; but he was wholly
ignorant of the mode by which it had been prepared,
and he could not obtain any information
upon this point from any of the French journals.</p>

<p>So curious and important a result could not fail
to interest him, as he had himself been long engaged
in experiments on the action of azote and chlorine,
without gaining any decided proofs of their power
of combining with each other. It was evident from
the notice, that this new body could not be formed
in any operations in which heat is concerned; he
therefore attempted to combine the elements by presenting
them to each other artificially cooled, the
azote being in a nascent state. For this purpose he
introduced chlorine into a solution of ammonia; a
violent action ensued, and minute films of a yellow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
colour were observed on the surface of the liquor,
but they immediately resolved themselves into gas.
As he was about to repeat the experiment with
some other ammoniacal compounds, Mr. Children
reminded him of the circumstance which he had
previously communicated to him in a letter, that
Mr. James Burton, jun<sup>r</sup>, on exposing chlorine to a
solution of nitrate of ammonia, had observed the
formation of a yellow oil, but which he had not been
able to collect. Davy availed himself of the hint,
and obtained the substance in question: on examining
its properties by the application of heat, the
tube in which it was contained was shivered to
atoms by its explosion, and he received a severe
wound in the transparent cornea, which was followed
by inflammation, and disabled him from
pursuing his enquiry.</p>

<p>In the following July, however, he communicated
in a second letter to Sir Joseph Banks, the continuation
of this enquiry, and furnished a full and satisfactory
history of the body in question. Having
procured it in sufficient quantity, he attempted to
effect its analysis by the action of mercury, but a
violent detonation occurred, and he was again
wounded in the head and hands; fortunately, however,
the injury was slight, in consequence of his
having taken the precaution to defend his face by a
plate of glass attached to a proper cap.</p>

<p>In a subsequent experiment, by using smaller
quantities, and recently distilled mercury, he succeeded
in obtaining results without any violence of
action: the mercury united with the chlorine, and
the azote was disengaged; from which he was enabled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
to conclude that it was composed of four
volumes of chlorine and one volume of azote. For
this new body Davy suggested the name of <em>Azotane</em>;
but I have already observed, that his nomenclature
of the compounds of chlorine has never been adopted;
the detonating substance is now very properly
denominated <em>Chloride of Nitrogen</em>.</p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of this paper, M.
Berzelius, in a letter to Professor Gilbert, asserted
that "<em>Azotane</em>" is nothing more than <em>dry</em> nitro-muriatic
acid, since it dissolves slowly in water, and
forms a weak <em>aqua regia</em>. "These few observations,"
says he, "show clearly that Davy's analysis of this
substance is inaccurate, and that he corrected his
results in consequence of theoretical views."</p>

<p>This was an imputation upon the philosophical
character of Davy, which excited in him no small
degree of indignation. In reply he says, "It is
difficult to discover what meaning M. Berzelius
attaches to the term <em>dry</em> nitro-muriatic acid; and it
is wholly unnecessary to refute so unfounded and
vague an assertion."</p>

<p>On July 8, 1813, a paper was read by Davy before
the Royal Society, entitled "Some Experiments
and Observations on the Substances produced in different
chemical processes on Fluor Spar."</p>

<p>The views which he formerly entertained with respect
to the fluoric acid have been already noticed:<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
in the present paper he renounces his previous opinions,
and establishes, by experiments of the most
satisfactory character, that the base of fluoric acid is
a highly energetic body not hitherto obtained in an
insulated form, and the properties peculiar to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
are as yet unknown. It appears, however, to belong
to the class of negative electrics, and, like oxygen
and chlorine, to have a powerful affinity for hydrogen
and metallic substances. With hydrogen, it
constitutes the peculiar and very powerful acid long
known by the name of <em>fluoric acid</em>,&mdash;with boron,
the <em>fluoboric</em>, and with silicium, the <em>silicated-fluoric</em>,
acids. Although this theory had originally suggested
itself to the mind of Davy, yet the chemical
world is unquestionably indebted to M. Ampère for
establishing it; and the English chemist has very
justly acknowledged the obligation. "During the
period that I was engaged in these investigations,"
says he, "I received two letters from M. Ampère, of
Paris, containing many ingenious and original arguments
in favour of the analogy between the muriatic
and fluoric compounds. M. Ampère communicated
his views to me in the most liberal manner:
they were formed in consequence of my ideas
on chlorine, and supported by reasonings drawn from
the experiments of MM. Gay Lussac and Thénard."</p>

<p>It has been stated that Davy gave his last public
lecture on the 9th of April 1812; he however afterwards
delivered an occasional lecture to the Managers,
on his own discoveries, and did not formally
resign his professorship until the next year.</p>

<p>The following record has been extracted from the
Journal of the Institution.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>"Minutes of the Proceedings of a general Monthly
Meeting of the Members of the Royal Institution,
held on Monday, April 5, 1813.</p>

<p>"Earl of Winchelsea, President, in the Chair.</p>

<p>"This being the meeting appointed by Article 2.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
chap. xix. of the bye-laws, for putting in nomination
from the chair the professors for the year ensuing,
Sir Humphry Davy rose, and begged leave to resign
his situation of Professor of Chemistry; but he by
no means wished to give up his connection with the
Royal Institution, as he should ever be happy to
communicate his researches, in the first instance, to
the Institution, in the manner he did in the presence
of the members last Wednesday, and to do all
in his power to promote the interest and success of
this Institution.</p>

<p>"Sir H. Davy having retired, Earl Spencer moved,
That the thanks of this Meeting be returned to Sir
H. Davy, for the inestimable services rendered by
him to the Royal Institution. This motion was seconded
by the Earl of Darnley, and on being put,
was carried unanimously.</p>

<p>"Earl Spencer further moved, That in order more
strongly to mark the high sense entertained by this
Meeting of the merits of Sir H. Davy, he be elected
Honorary Professor of Chemistry; which, on being
seconded by the Earl of Darnley, met with unanimous
approbation.</p>

<p>"The Chairman having declared the Professorship
of Chemistry vacant, put in nomination William
Thomas Brande, Esq. F.R.S. as a candidate for
that office, with a salary of 200<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>"On Monday, June 7, 1813, William Thomas
Brande, Esq. was unanimously elected."</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>In March 1813, Davy published his "Elements
of Agricultural Chemistry," being the substance of
a course of lectures which he had, for ten successive
seasons, delivered before the members of the Board
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
of Agriculture, to whom the work is inscribed, as a
mark of the author's respect.</p>

<p>This work, which may be considered as the only
system of philosophical agriculture ever published
in this country, has not only contributed to the advancement
of science, but to that for which he has
an equal claim upon our gratitude,&mdash;the diffusion
of a taste amongst the higher classes for its cultivation;
for it has been wisely remarked, that not he
alone is to be esteemed a benefactor to mankind
who makes an useful discovery, but he, also, who
can point out an innocent pleasure.</p>

<p>It has been already stated, that Davy became
early impressed with the importance of the subject:&mdash;that
in future life its investigation should have
been to him so fertile a source of pleasure, may be
readily imagined, when it is remembered with what
passionate delight he contemplated the ever varying
forms of creation. "I am," said he, "a lover of
Nature, with an ungratified imagination, and I shall
continue to search for untasted charms&mdash;for hidden
beauties." In unfolding, then, the secrets of vegetable
life, he did but remove the veil from his mistress.
From the same poetical feeling sprang his
love of angling: it was a pursuit which carried
him into the wild and beautiful scenery of Nature,
amongst the mountain lakes, and the clear and
lovely streams that gush from elevated hills, or
make their way through the cavities of calcareous
strata.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> In the early spring, it led him forth upon
the fresh turf in the vernal sunshine, to scent the
odour of the bank perfumed by the violet, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
enamelled with the primrose, while his heart participated
in the renovated gladness of Nature.</p>

<p>I had hoped that, amidst the voluminous correspondence
of my late friend Mr. Arthur Young,
some important letters might have been found from
Davy on agricultural subjects; but the communications
which took place between them were generally
in conversation, and I have therefore only been able
to procure two letters, which I shall here insert:
the first will show that, during his tours, his attention
was alive to the practices of husbandry; and
the second will prove that he had once seriously
contemplated the labour of writing the agricultural
history of his native county.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO ARTHUR YOUNG, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date"> Killarney, June 1806.</p>

<p class="opening">DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>You have been of great and durable service to
Ireland. I have met with a number of persons who
have been enlightened by your labours, and who
now follow an enlightened system of Agriculture.
One very intelligent gentleman you will recollect,&mdash;Mr.
Bolton of Waterford: he is zealously pursuing
improvements, and is instructing his neighbours by
precept and example. I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="smcap signature">H. Davy.</p>
</div>

<p>The above letter contains also some observations
on a chemical mixture, but which is unintelligible
from our being ignorant of the conversation to
which it refers.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">TO THE SAME.</p>

<p class="date">  April, 1807.</p>

<p class="opening">DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>I called this morning with the hope of seeing
you, and of gaining some explanation on the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
of your note. I shall not be able to leave London
until the middle of July, and I must return
early in October.</p>

<p>I do not think there would be sufficient time
between these periods for accomplishing the objects
you mention; nor do I think myself qualified to
write upon the agriculture of a county. I wished
likewise to devote the leisure of this summer to
the preparation of my lectures on the Chemistry of
Agriculture for publication. I have a great deal of
information concerning the mineralogy and geology
of Cornwall, but none concerning the farming.</p>

<p>If the business admits of being postponed, I
might perhaps be able to accomplish it next summer;
that is, by devoting a part of this summer,
and the whole of my next: but I would rather confine
myself to my own province, the mineralogy
and geology of the county, and leave the agriculture
to abler hands.</p>

<p>Be pleased to receive my thanks, and to communicate
them to the President for the honour of the
proposal. I remain, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="smcap signature">H. Davy.</p>
</div>

<p>The majority of my readers will probably concur
in the wisdom of this decision: they will consider
that to have doomed Davy to a drudgery of this
nature, would have been wasting talents upon an
object which might be accomplished by smaller
means. From my acquaintance, however, with Cornwall,
I am induced to form a different opinion.
Davy never approached even those subjects which
had already received from others the most thorough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
investigation, without extracting from them new
and important truths. What, then, might not have
been expected from his genius, when applied to a
department upon which the light of science had
scarcely dawned?</p>

<p>It is only in a primitive country like Cornwall,
that the natural relations between the varieties of
soil and the subjacent rocks can be studied with
success: as we advance to alluvial districts, such
relations become gradually less distinct and apparent,
and are ultimately lost in the confused complication
of the soil itself, and in that general obscurity
which envelopes every object in the ulterior stages
of decomposition. We can, therefore, only hope to
succeed in such an investigation by a patient and
laborious examination of a primitive country, after
which we may be enabled to extend our enquiries
with greater advantage through those regions which
are more completely covered with soil, and obscured
by luxuriant vegetation; as the eye, acquainted
with the human figure, on gazing upon a beautiful
statue, traces the outline of the limbs, and the swelling
contour of its form, through the flowing draperies
which invest it. The importance of the subject,
as well as the general interest it has excited,
induce me to offer an analysis of his "Elements of
Agricultural Chemistry."</p>

<p>The work is divided into eight lectures; and in
his introductory chapter, after adverting to the difficulties
which the enquiry presents to the lecturer,
he offers a general view of the objects of the course,
and of the order in which he proposes to discuss
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
"Agricultural Chemistry has not yet received a
regular and systematic form. It has been pursued
by competent experimenters for a short time only;
the doctrines have not as yet been collected into an
elementary treatise; and on an occasion when I am
obliged to trust so much to my own arrangements,
and to my own limited information, I cannot but
feel diffident as to the interest that may be excited,
and doubtful of the success of the undertaking. I
know, however, that your candour will induce you
not to expect any thing like a finished work upon a
science as yet in its infancy; and I am sure you
will receive with indulgence the first attempt made
to illustrate it, in a distinct course of lectures.</p>

<p>"Agricultural Chemistry has for its objects all
those changes in the arrangements of matter connected
with the growth and nourishment of plants;
the comparative values of their produce as food;
the constitution of soils; and the manner in which
lands are enriched by manure, or rendered fertile by
the different processes of cultivation." That such
objects are intimately connected with the doctrines
of chemistry, he proceeds to show by several appropriate
and striking illustrations.</p>

<p>"If land be unproductive, and a system of ameliorating
it is to be attempted, the sure method of
obtaining the object is, by determining the cause of
its sterility, which must necessarily depend upon
some defect in the constitution of the soil, which
may be easily discovered by chemical analysis. Are
any of the salts of iron present? they may be decomposed
by lime. Is there an excess of siliceous
sand? the system of improvement must depend on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
the application of clay and calcareous matter. Is
there a defect of calcareous matter? the remedy is
obvious. Is an excess of vegetable matter indicated?
it may be removed by liming, paring, and
burning. Is there a deficiency of vegetable matter?
it is to be supplied by manure."</p>

<p>"In the selection also of the remedy, after the discovery
of the evil, chemical knowledge is of the
highest importance. Limestone varies in its composition,
and by its indiscriminate application we
may aggravate the sterility we seek to obviate.
Peat earth is an excellent manure, but it may contain
such an excess of iron as to be absolutely poisonous
to plants. How are such difficulties to be
met but by the resources of chemistry? It is also
evident that the scientific agriculturist should possess
a general knowledge of the nature and composition
of material bodies, and the laws of their
changes; for the surface of the earth, the atmosphere,
and the water deposited from it, must, either
together or separately, afford all the principles concerned
in vegetation; and it is only by examining
the chemical nature of these principles, that we are
capable of discovering what is the food of plants,
and the manner in which this food is supplied and
prepared for their nourishment."</p>

<p>Davy likewise advocates the necessity of studying
"the phenomena of vegetation, as an important
branch of the science of organized nature; for, although
exalted above inorganic matter, vegetables
are yet in a great measure dependent for their existence
upon its laws. They receive their nourishment
from the external elements; they assimilate it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
by means of peculiar organs; and it is by examining
their physical and chemical constitution, and the
substances and powers which act upon them, and
the modifications which they undergo, that the
scientific principles of Agricultural Chemistry are
obtained."</p>

<p>With respect, however, to the practical utility of
this latter branch, different opinions have been entertained.
I confess, I am inclined to agree with
an able reviewer<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> when he says, "It is the proper
business of the chemist to examine and ascertain the
nature and properties of dead and inorganized matter,
and the various combinations which, according
to chemical laws, it is capable of forming. The
chemical composition of organized bodies, and of
the products which they form, fall likewise under
his cognizance; but when he proceeds to consider
the physical constitution of these bodies, and the
manner in which they act in forming their products,
he no longer works with the instruments of the
laboratory, or conducts processes which can be properly
imitated there."</p>

<p>In concluding his introductory observations, he
remarks upon the prejudice which persons, who
argue in favour of practice and experience, very
commonly entertain against all attempts to improve
agriculture by philosophical enquiries and chemical
methods. "That much vague speculation may be
found in the works of those who have lightly taken
up agricultural chemistry, it is impossible to deny.
It is not uncommon to find a number of changes
rung upon a string of technical terms, such as oxygen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
hydrogen, carbon, and azote, as if the science
depended upon words, rather than upon things.
But this is, in fact, an argument for the necessity of
the establishment of just principles of chemistry on
the subject.&mdash;If a person journeying in the night
wishes to avoid being led astray by the ignis fatuus,
the most secure method is to carry a lamp in his
own hand."</p>

<p>"There is no idea more unfounded than that a
great devotion of time, and a minute knowledge of
general chemistry, are necessary for pursuing experiments
on the nature of soils, or the properties of
manures. The expense connected with chemical
enquiries is extremely trifling: a small closet is
sufficient for containing all the materials required."</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Second Lecture</span>, he enters upon the
consideration of the general powers of matter, such
as gravitation, cohesion, chemical attraction, heat,
light, and electricity; and then proceeds to examine
the elements of matter, and the laws of their combinations
and arrangements.</p>

<p>To an audience constituted of persons who were
not familiar with the elementary principles of the
science, it might have been very necessary for the
lecturer to enter upon such preliminary details; but
there cannot be any good reason for his having published
them in his system. As they are to be found
in every work on chemistry, it will not be necessary
to bestow upon them any further notice.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Third Lecture</span>, he enters into a description
of the organization and living system of plants;
in which he connects together into a general view,
the observations of the most enlightened philosophers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
who have studied the physiology of vegetation&mdash;those
of Grew, Malpighi, Sennebier, Hales, Decandolle,
Saussure, Bonnet, Darwin, Smith, and
above all, of Mr. Knight, whose enquiries upon
these subjects are not only the latest, but by far the
most satisfactory and conclusive.</p>

<p>As there is little in these descriptions that may
not be found in the original authors, I shall not unnecessarily
trespass upon the time of the reader by
relating them. In the latter part of this lecture, he
describes the properties and ultimate composition of
the proximate principles of which vegetable matter
consists, and into which it may be resolved by different
processes of art; such are gum, starch, sugar,
albumen, gluten, extract, tannin, resin, oils, &amp;c. &amp;c.
But since the publication of this work, vegetable
analysis has advanced to a degree of refinement
which could scarcely have been anticipated in so
short a period, and consequently many of his statements
appear deficient; but his general directions
for conducting an analysis of any vegetable substance,
with a degree of accuracy sufficient for the
views of the agriculturist, remain unimpeached.</p>

<p>The most valuable, and more strictly original part
of this lecture, is his statement of the quantity of
soluble or nutritive matters contained in varieties of
the different substances that are used as articles of
food, either for man or cattle, and which he has
displayed in a tabular form.</p>

<p>The analyses were his own, and were conducted
with a view to a knowledge of the general nature
and quantity of the products, rather than to that of
their intimate chemical composition. He proceeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
upon the assumption, that the excellence of the different
articles, as food, will be in a great measure proportional
to the quantities of soluble matter they afford;
although he admits that these quantities cannot be regarded
as <em>absolutely</em> denoting their value. Albuminous
or glutinous matters have the characters of animal
substances; sugar is more, and extractive matter
less nourishing than any other principles composed
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Certain combinations
likewise of these substances may be more nutritive
than others. There are some principles also,
which, although soluble in the vessels of the chemist,
pass through the alimentary canal of animals without
change; such is <em>tannin</em>: on the other hand,
there are bodies which, although sparingly soluble
in water, are readily acted upon by the gastric juice;
<em>gluten</em> is a principle of this description.</p>

<p>Shortly after Dr. Wollaston published his scale
of chemical equivalents, it occurred to me that by
applying the sliding rule to a series of nutritive substances,
arranged according to the analyses of Davy,
some curious and important problems<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> might be
solved; or at least, that the accuracy of the conclusions
might be thus conveniently submitted to the
test of practice. I accordingly superintended the
construction of such an instrument, and submitted
it to Davy, who expressed his approbation of the
principle, but doubted how far the accuracy of his
analyses would justify the experiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
To such a scheme, however, I soon found that
there existed a much more serious objection. The
operation of the insoluble matter had been wholly
neglected; and whatever views the chemist may
entertain, the experience of the physiologist has
established, beyond doubt, the influence of such
matter in the process of digestion. The capacity
of the alimentary organs of graminivorous animals
sufficiently proves that they were designed for the
reception of a <em>large bulk</em> of food, and not for provender
in which the nutritive matter is concentrated;
and since the gramineous and leguminous
vegetables do not present this matter in a separate
state, and the animal is not furnished with
an apparatus by which he can remove it, the obvious
inference is, that he was designed to feed indiscriminately
upon the whole; and that, unless
bulk be taken into the account, no fair inference
can be deduced as to the nutritive value of different
vegetables.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the difficulties which prevent
our arriving at any thing like an accurate conclusion
upon so complicated a subject, the results may
be received as affording some general views with
regard to the comparative value of different nutritive
vegetables. It would thus appear that at
least a fourth part of the weight of the potatoe
consists of nutritive matter, which is principally
starch;&mdash;that wheat consists of as much as ninety-five,
barley of ninety-two, oats of seventy-five, rye
of eighty, and peas and beans of about fifty-seven
per cent. of nutritive matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Fourth Lecture</span> comprises subjects of the
utmost importance, and must be considered as constituting
by far the most original and valuable
division of the work. It treats of soils,&mdash;their
constituent parts, their chemical analysis, their uses,
their improvement, and of the rocks and strata
found beneath their surface.</p>

<p>In the execution of this part of his labours, he
has not only improved on the processes of Fordyce
and Kirwan, but he has enriched the subject with
much interesting and novel research.</p>

<p>"Soils, although extremely diversified in appearance
and quality, consist of comparatively few elements,
which are in various states of chemical combination,
or of mechanical mixture.</p>

<p>"These substances are silica, lime, alumina, magnesia,
the oxides of iron, and of manganese; animal
and vegetable matters in a state of decomposition;
together with certain saline bodies, such as common
salt, sulphate of magnesia, sometimes sulphate of
iron, nitrates of lime and magnesia, sulphate of potash,
and the carbonates of potash and soda.</p>

<p>"The silica in soils is usually combined with
alumina and oxide of iron; or with alumina, lime,
magnesia, and oxide of iron, forming gravel and
sand of different degrees of fineness. The carbonate
of lime is usually in an impalpable form; but sometimes
in the state of calcareous sand. The magnesia,
if not combined in the gravel and sand of the
soil, is in a fine powder united to carbonic acid.
The impalpable part of the soil, which is commonly
called clay or loam, consists of silica, alumina, lime,
and magnesia; and is, in fact, visually of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
composition as the hard sand, but more finely divided.
The vegetable, or animal matters (and the
first is by far the most common in soils,) exist in
different states of decomposition. They are sometimes
fibrous, sometimes entirely broken down and
mixed with the soil.</p>

<p>"To form a just idea of soils, it is necessary to
conceive different rocks decomposed, or ground into
parts and powder of different degrees of fineness;
some of their soluble parts dissolved by water, and
that water adhering to the mass, and the whole
mixed with larger or smaller quantities of the remains
of vegetables and animals, in different stages
of decay."</p>

<p>Soils, then, would appear to have been originally
produced from the disintegration of rocks and strata;
and hence there must be at least as many varieties
of them, as there are species of rocks exposed at the
surface of the earth; and they may be distinguished
by names derived from the rocks from which they
were formed. Thus, if a fine red earth be found immediately
above decomposing basalt, it may be denominated
<em>basaltic</em> soil. If fragments of quartz and
mica be found abundant, it may be denominated
<em>granitic</em> soil; and the same principles may be extended
to other analogous cases.</p>

<p>A general knowledge then of geology becomes
essential to the scientific agriculturist, not only to
enable him to form a correct judgment with respect
to the connection between the varieties of soil and
the subjacent rocks, but to direct him to the different
mineral substances which may be associated
together in their vicinity, and which may contain
principles capable of extending their fertility, or of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
correcting the circumstances upon which their poverty
or barrenness may depend.</p>

<p>With this conviction, Davy proceeds to offer a
general view of the nature and position of rocks and
strata in nature; but which, I confess, appears to
me to be wholly useless to those who have any
acquaintance with the subject, and far too meagre
to convey any instruction to those who have not
made this branch of science an object of study.</p>

<p>Upon this view, however, he has grounded a
number of valuable remarks; although his observations
appear to have been too limited to enable
him to do justice to a subject of such extent and
importance. Had he fulfilled his intention of making
a survey of the county of Cornwall, the science
must have been greatly advanced by his labours, for
there is no district in Great Britain so rich in fact,
and so capable of elucidating the history of soil, and
the advantages of cultivation, when conducted on
the principles of chemical philosophy. The soils
superincumbent upon the different rocks are distinct
and characteristic; and even in the same species
varieties may be observed, in consequence of geological
peculiarities. I have, for instance, found
that the fertility of a granitic soil is increased by
the abundance of felspar in the parent rock;&mdash;that
of a slaty soil by the degree of inclination or dip of
the strata: but the most extraordinary circumstance
perhaps connected with this subject, is the very
remarkable fertility of the land which lies over the
junction of these rocks,&mdash;so obvious indeed is it,
that the eye alone is sufficient to trace it.</p>

<p>We are indebted to the author, in this lecture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
for some very ingenious and important remarks on
the relations of different soils to heat and moisture,
and for a series of experiments by which his views
are supported.</p>

<p>Some soils, he observes, are more easily heated
and more easily cooled than others: for example,
those that consist principally of a stiff white clay
are heated with difficulty; and being usually very
moist, they retain their heat only for a short time.
<em>Chalks</em> also are difficultly heated; but being dryer,
they retain their heat longer, less being consumed
in the process of evaporation.</p>

<p>A black soil, and those that contain much carbonaceous
or ferruginous matter, acquire a higher temperature
by exposure to the sun, than pale-coloured
soils.</p>

<p>When soils are perfectly dry, those that most
readily become heated, most rapidly cool; but the
darkest-coloured dry soil, abounding in animal and
vegetable matters, cools more slowly than a wet pale
soil, composed entirely of earthy matter.</p>

<p>These results Davy gained by experiments made
on different kinds of soils, exposed for a given time
to the sun, and in the shade; the degrees of heating
and cooling having been accurately ascertained by
the thermometer.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more evident, than that the
genial heat of the soil, particularly in spring, must
be of the highest importance to the rising plant.
And when the leaves are fully developed, the
ground is shaded, and any injurious influence,
which in the summer might be expected from too
great a heat, entirely prevented; so that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
temperature of the surface, when bare and exposed to
the rays of the sun, affords at least one indication
of the degree of its fertility; and the thermometer
may therefore be sometimes a useful instrument to
the purchaser or improver of lands.</p>

<p>Water is said to exist in soils, either in a state of
chemical combination, or of cohesive attraction. It
is in the latter state only that it can be absorbed by
the roots of plants, unless in the case of the decomposition
of animal and vegetable substances. The
more divided the parts of the soil are, the greater is
its attractive power for water; and the addition of
vegetable and animal matters still farther increases
this power.</p>

<p>The quality of soils to absorb water from air, is
much connected with fertility. Davy informs us
that he has compared this absorbent power in numerous
instances, and that he always found it greatest
in the most productive lands: he states, however,
the important fact, that those soils, such for instance
as stiff clays, which take up the greatest quantity
of water, when it is poured upon them in a fluid
form, are not such as absorb most moisture from
the atmosphere in dry weather. They cake, and
present only a small surface to the air, and the vegetation
on them is generally burnt up almost as
readily as on sands.</p>

<p>There is probably no district in which the importance
of moisture in relation to fertility is more
apparent than in Cornwall; and there is a provincial
saying, that the land will bear a shower every weekday,
and two upon a Sunday: indeed, of such importance
is moisture, that it is by no means an uncommon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
practice to encourage the growth of weeds,
in order to diminish the evaporation; a necessity
which arises from the excess of siliceous matter in
the soil.</p>

<p>To those who are disposed to prosecute this enquiry,
I should recommend a perusal of Mr. Leslie's
treatise on the "Relations of Air to Heat and
Moisture."</p>

<p>I must not quit the consideration of this lecture,
without adverting to the directions with which its
author has furnished the philosophical farmer for
analysing the different varieties of soil; and which
are so clear, so perfect, and above all so simple, that
they are now introduced into all elementary works
on chemistry, as the only guide to such researches.
His method for ascertaining the quantity of carbonate
of lime in any specimen, consists in determining
the loss of weight which takes place on its admixture
with muriatic acid; for since carbonate of lime,
in all its states, contains a determinate proportion of
carbonic acid, it is evident that, by estimating the
quantity of elastic matter given out, the proportion
of carbonate of lime will be known. For conducting
this experiment, he contrived a very simple and
ingenious piece of pneumatic apparatus, in which
the bulk of the carbonic acid is at once measured
by the quantity of water it displaces.</p>

<p>In his <span class="smcap">Fifth Lecture</span> he enters upon the nature
of the atmosphere, and its influence on vegetables:
he also examines the process of the germination of
seeds, and the functions of plants in their different
stages of growth; and concludes with a general
view of the progress of vegetation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
I shall merely mention a few of the more interesting
points in this enquiry.</p>

<p>In illustrating the importance of water to the
vegetable creation, he observes that the atmosphere
always contains water in its elastic and invisible
form, the quantity of which will vary with the temperature.
In proportion as the weather is hotter,
the quantity is greater; and it is its condensation
by diminution of temperature, which gives rise to
the phenomena of dew and mist. The leaves of
living plants appear to act upon this vapour, and to
absorb it. Some vegetables increase in weight from
this cause, when suspended in the atmosphere, and
unconnected with the soil; such are the house-leek,
and different species of the aloe. In very intense
heats, and when the soil is dry, the life of plants
seems to be preserved by the absorbent powers of
their leaves; and it is a beautiful circumstance in
the economy of Nature, that aqueous vapour is most
abundant in the atmosphere when it is most needed
for the purposes of life; and that when other sources
of its supply are cut off, this is most copious.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
If water in its elastic and fluid states be essentially
necessary to the economy of vegetation, so
even in its solid form, it is not without its uses.
Snow and ice are bad conductors of heat; and at a
period when the severity of the winter threatens
the extinction of vegetable life, Nature kindly
throws her snowy mantle over the surface; while in
early spring the solution of the snow becomes the
first nourishment of the plant; at the same time, the
expansion of water in the act of congelation, and
the subsequent contraction of its bulk during a
thaw, tend to pulverise the soil, to separate its parts
from each other, and, by making it more permeable
to the influence of the air, to prepare it for the offices
it is destined to perform.</p>

<p>He next proceeds to consider the action of the
atmosphere on plants, and to connect it with a general
view of the progress of vegetation. He commences
with examining its relations to germination.</p>

<p>"If a healthy seed be moistened and exposed to
air at a temperature not below 45°, it soon germinates;
it shoots forth a <em>plume</em> which rises upwards,
and a <em>radicle</em> which descends.</p>

<p>"If the air be confined, it is found that, in the
process of germination, the oxygen, or a part of it,
is absorbed. The azote remains unaltered; no carbonic
acid is taken away from the air; on the contrary,
some is added." Upon this point, critics have
been disposed to break a lance with Sir Humphry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
The doctrine, let it be observed, is at variance with
the numerous experiments made on this subject by
Scheele, Cruickshank, and De Saussure; the results
of which agree in proving, that if seeds be confined
and made to germinate in a given portion of air, not
a <em>part</em> only, but the <em>whole</em> of the oxygen is consumed;
and that its place is supplied, not merely by
<em>some</em>, but by an <em>equal bulk</em> of carbonic acid.</p>

<p>Objections have been also started to his theory of
the chemical changes which the seed undergoes
during the process of germination: but were I to
enter upon these discussions, time and space would
alike fail me, to say nothing of the patience of the
reader, which would be exhausted long before we
could arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. I shall
for the same reasons pass over his observations upon
the influence exerted upon growing plants on the
air: the subject is involved in much difficulty,
which can be only removed by fresh experiments;
nor, after all, is the great question, whether the
purity of the atmosphere is maintained by vegetation,
of any practical moment,&mdash;it is one which partakes
more of curiosity than of use, and might
therefore have been well dispensed with in a system
of agriculture.</p>

<p>He agrees with many other philosophers in considering
"the process of malting as merely one in
which germination is artificially produced, and in
which the starch is changed into sugar, which sugar
is afterwards, by fermentation, converted into spirit.</p>

<p>"It is," he continues, "very evident from the
chemical principles of germination, that the process
should be carried on no farther than to produce the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
sprouting of the radicle, and should be checked as
soon as this has made its distinct appearance. If it
is pushed to such a degree as to occasion the perfect
developement of the radicle and the plume, a considerable
quantity of saccharine matter will have
been consumed in producing their expansion, and
there will be less spirit formed in fermentation, or
produced in distillation.</p>

<p>"As this circumstance is of some importance, I
made, in October 1806, an experiment relating to it.
I ascertained by the action of alcohol, the relative
proportions of saccharine matter in two equal quantities
of the same barley; in one of which the germination
had proceeded so far as to occasion protrusion
of the radicle to nearly a quarter of an inch
beyond the grain in most of the specimens, and in
the other of which it had been checked before the
radicle was a line in length; the quantity of sugar
afforded by the last was to that in the first nearly as
six to five."</p>

<p>The whole of this subject appears to be debateable
ground between the physiologists and chemists: the
one considering the change of starch into sugar as
the result of the vital action of the seed; the other
affirming that the growth of the germ is in no way necessary
to the result, and is to be considered as a mere
indication of the due degree of change being effected
in the organic matter, or, in other words, that when
the organized parts exhibit a certain degree of developement,
then the inorganic matter is most completely
changed. All growth beyond this is injurious,
as leading to a consumption of the inorganic
matter. All less than this is not otherwise disadvantageous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
than as an indication that the inorganic
matter is not duly changed. This change, it is
farther affirmed, so far from depending upon vegetable
life, can be wrought on the matter of the seed
after it is even reduced to powder, or is separated in
the form of starch. At all events, it must be admitted
as a beautiful arrangement in nature, that
the same agents which urge on the developement
of the organized parts, should, at the same time,
assist in preparing food for their support.</p>

<p>From this subject Davy is very naturally led to
the consideration of the ravages inflicted upon the
infant plant by insects; the saccharine matter in the
cotyledons at the time of their change into seed-leaves,
rendering them exceedingly liable to such
attacks. He appears to have bestowed much attention
on the turnip-fly, a colyopterous insect, which
fixes itself upon the seed-leaves of the turnip at
the time that they are beginning to perform their
functions. He relates the several remedies which
have been proposed for this evil; and from letters
which have been put in my possession, addressed to
Dr. Cartwright as early as the year 1804, he appears
to have been engaged with that gentleman in experiments
made by sprinkling the young plants with
lime and urine.</p>

<p>After alluding to the parasitical plants of different
species, which attach themselves to trees and shrubs,
feed on their juices, destroy their health, and finally
their life, for which, at present, there does not exist
any remedy, he thus concludes his lecture:</p>

<p>"To enumerate all the animal destroyers, and
tyrants of the vegetable kingdom, would be to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
a catalogue of the greater number of the classes in
Zoology. Every species of plant almost is the
peculiar resting-place, or dominion, of some insect
tribe; and from the locust, the caterpillar, and snail,
to the minute aphis, a wonderful variety of the inferior
insects are nourished, and live by their ravages
upon the vegetable world.</p>

<p>"The Hessian fly, still more destructive to wheat
than the one which ravages the turnip plant, has in
some seasons threatened the United States with a
famine. And the French government is at this
time<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> issuing decrees with a view to occasion the
destruction of the larvæ of the grasshopper.</p>

<p>"In general, wet weather is most favourable to
the propagation of mildew, funguses, rust, and the
small parasitical vegetables; dry weather, to the increase
of the insect tribes. Nature, amidst all her
changes, is continually directing her resources towards
the production and multiplication of life;
and in the wise and grand economy of the whole
system, even the agents that appear injurious to
the hopes, and destructive to the comforts of man,
are in fact ultimately connected with a more exalted
state of his powers and his condition. His industry
is awakened, his activity kept alive, even by the
defects of climates and season. By the accidents
which interfere with his efforts, he is made to exert
his talents, to look farther into futurity, and to consider
the vegetable kingdom, not as a secure and
unalterable inheritance spontaneously providing for
his wants, but as a doubtful and insecure possession,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
to be preserved only by labour, and extended
and perfected by ingenuity."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">His Sixth Lecture</span> treats of manures of animal
and vegetable origin, and of the general principles
with respect to their uses and modes of application.</p>

<p>It is evident that plants, by their growth, must
gradually exhaust the soil of its richer and more nutrient
parts; and these can be alone restored by the
application of manures. It is equally obvious, that
if a soil be sterile from any defect in its constitution,
such a defect can be only remedied by artificial additions.
Hence the introduction of foreign matter
into the earth, for the purpose of accelerating vegetation,
and of increasing the produce of its crops, is
a practice which has been pursued since the earliest
period of agriculture. Unfortunately, however, the
greatest ignorance has prevailed in all ages with regard
to the best modes of rendering such a resource
available; and the farmer, instead of enriching the
soil, has too frequently given his treasures to the
winds. "It is quite lamentable," says an intelligent
writer,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> "to survey a farm-yard in many parts of
the kingdom; to see the abundance of vegetable
matter that is trodden for months under-foot, over a
surface of perhaps half an acre of land, exposed to
all the rains that fall, by which its more soluble and
richer parts are washed away, or perhaps carried
down to poison the water of some stagnant pool,
which the unfortunate cattle are afterwards compelled
to drink. From the yard, the manure is
often carted to the field, at the time when the land
is rendered impenetrable by frost; or, if this operation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
be delayed to a less unseasonable period, it is
then frequently laid down in small heaps, or sometimes
spread over the surface, exposed for many
days to the sun, the winds, and the rain, as if with
the direct design of dissipating those more volatile
parts which it ought to be the farmer's first endeavour
to preserve.</p>

<p>"Nothing can be so likely to remove ignorance
so deplorable, and prejudices so inveterate, as the
diffusion of real knowledge concerning the nature of
manures, and their mode of action on soils, and on
the plants which grow in them."</p>

<p>Davy, fully sensible of the practical importance
of the subject, and impressed with the conviction
that it was capable of being materially elucidated by
the recent discoveries of chemistry, determined to
put forth his strength, in order to bring this department
of agriculture under the dominion of science;
and upon this occasion our philosopher presents
himself in the only character in which he ever ought
to appear&mdash;in that of an original experimentalist.</p>

<p>His first step in the enquiry was to ascertain whether
solid substances can pass from the soil through
the minute pores in the fibres of the root. He tried
an experiment by introducing a growing plant of
peppermint into water which held in suspension a
quantity of impalpably powdered charcoal: but
after a fortnight, upon cutting through different
parts of the roots, no carbonaceous matter could be
discovered in them, nor were the smallest fibres
even blackened,&mdash;though this must have happened,
had the charcoal been absorbed in a solid form. If
a substance so essential to plants as carbonaceous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
matter cannot be introduced except in a state of
solution into their organs, he very justly concludes
that other less essential bodies must be in the same
case.</p>

<p>He also proved by experiment that solutions of
sugar, mucilage, jelly, and other principles, unless
considerably diluted, clogged up the vegetable organs
with solid matter, and prevented the transpiration
by the leaves: when, however, this precaution
was taken, the plants grew most luxuriantly
in such liquids.</p>

<p>He next proceeded to determine whether soluble
vegetable substances passed in an unchanged state
into the roots of plants, by comparing the products
of the analysis of the roots of plants of mint which
had grown, some in common water, some in a solution
of sugar: the results favoured the opinion
that they were so absorbed. It appeared, moreover,
that substances even poisonous to vegetables did
not offer an objection to this law. He introduced
the roots of a primrose into a weak solution of
oxide of iron in vinegar, and suffered them to remain
in it till the leaves became yellow; the roots
were then carefully washed in distilled water,
bruised, and boiled in a small quantity of the same
fluid: the decoction of them passed through a filtre
was examined, and found to contain iron; so that
this metal must have been taken up by the vessels
or pores in the root.</p>

<p>If to these facts are added those connected with
the changes which animal and vegetable substances
undergo by the process of putrefaction, we have all
the data necessary for forming a rational theory,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
to guide us in the management and application of
manures.</p>

<p>Davy has very satisfactorily shown the cases in
which putrefaction or fermentation should be encouraged,
and avoided. As a general rule, it may
be stated, that when manure consists principally
of matter soluble in water, its fermentation or putrefaction
should be prevented as much as possible;
but on the contrary, when it contains a large proportion
of vegetable or animal fibre, such processes
become necessary.</p>

<p>To prevent manures from decomposing, he recommends
that they should be preserved dry, defended
from the contact of the air, and kept as
cool as possible. Salt and alcohol, he observes, appear
to owe their powers of preserving animal and
vegetable substances to their attraction for water,
by which they prevent its decomposing action, and
likewise to their excluding air. The importance
of this latter circumstance he illustrates by the success
of M. Appart's method of preserving meat.</p>

<p>By allowing the fermentation of manure to proceed
beneath the soil, rather than in the farm-yard,
we not only preserve elements which would otherwise
be dissipated, but we obtain several incidental
advantages; for example, the production of <em>heat</em>,
which is useful in promoting the germination of
the seed. This must be particularly favourable
to the wheat crop, in preserving a genial temperature
beneath the surface late in autumn, and
during winter.</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;it is a general principle in chemistry,
that in all cases of decomposition, substances combine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
much more readily at the moment of their
disengagement, than after they have been perfectly
formed. And in fermentation beneath the soil, the
fluid matter produced is applied instantly, even
whilst it is warm, to the organs of the plant, and
consequently is more likely to be efficient than in
manure that has gone through the process, and of
which all the principles have already entered into
new combinations.</p>

<p>He examines with much attention the various
animal and vegetable matters which have been used
as manure, and furnishes the farmer with a number
of practical remarks on their nature and mode
of operation. For these, the reader must refer to
the work itself; for my limits will not allow me
to enter into the consideration of <em>rape-cake</em>&mdash;<em>malt-dust</em>&mdash;<em>linseed-cake</em>&mdash;<em>sea-weeds</em>&mdash;<em>peat</em>&mdash;<em>wood-ashes</em>&mdash;<em>fish</em>&mdash;<em>bones</em>&mdash;<em>hair</em>,
<em>woollen rags</em>, <em>and feathers</em>&mdash;<em>blood</em>,
&amp;c. &amp;c.; to each of which he assigns peculiar
qualities and virtues.</p>

<p>As he regards the due regulation of the fermentative
process of the utmost importance, he has
furnished some valuable hints for the conduct of
the farmer upon this occasion. He considers that
a compact marle, or a tenacious clay, offers the best
protection against the air; and before the dung is
covered over, or, as it were, sealed up, he recommends
that it should be dried as much as possible.
If at any time it should heat strongly, he advises
the farmer to turn it over, and thus cool it by
exposure to the air; for the practice sometimes
adopted of watering dunghills is inconsistent with
just chemical views. It may cool the dung for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
short time; but moisture, it will be remembered, is
a principal agent in all processes of decomposition.</p>

<p>In cases of the fermentation of dung, there are
simple tests by which the rapidity of the process, and
consequently the injury done, may be discovered.
If, for instance, a thermometer plunged into the mass
does not rise above 100°, it may be concluded that
there is not much danger of the escape of aëriform
matter; but should it exceed this, the dung ought
to be immediately spread abroad.</p>

<p>When a piece of paper moistened in muriatic acid,
held over the steams arising from a dunghill, gives
dense fumes, it is a certain test that the decomposition
is going too far; for this indicates that volatile
alkali is disengaged.</p>

<p>It may be truly said that, under the hand of
Davy, the coldest realities blossomed into poetry:
the concluding passage of this lecture certainly sanctions
such an opinion, and is highly characteristic of
that peculiar genius to which I have before alluded.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
A subject less calculated than a heap of manure to
call forth a glowing sentiment, can scarcely be imagined.</p>

<p>"The doctrine," says he, "of the proper application
of manures from organized substances, offers
an illustration of an important part of the economy
of nature, and of the happy order in which it is
arranged. The death and decay of animal substances
tend to resolve organized forms into chemical
constituents; and the pernicious effluvia disengaged
in the process seem to point out the propriety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
of burying them in the soil, where they are
fitted to become the food of vegetables. The fermentation
and putrefaction of organized substances
in the free atmosphere are noxious processes; beneath
the surface of the ground they are salutary
operations. In this case the food of plants is prepared
where it can be used; and that which would
offend the senses, and injure the health, if exposed,
is converted by gradual processes into forms of
beauty and of usefulness; the fetid gas is rendered
a constituent of the aroma of the flower, and
what might be poison, becomes nourishment to
man and animals."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventh Lecture</span> is devoted to the investigation
of manures of a mineral origin. He
commences the subject by refuting the opinion of
Schrader and Braconnot, that the different earthy
and saline substances found in plants arise from new
arrangements of the elements of air and water, by
the agencies of their living organs.</p>

<p>In 1801, he made an experiment on the growth
of oats, supplied with a limited quantity of distilled
water, in a soil composed of pure carbonate of lime.
The soil and the water were placed in a vessel of
iron, which was included in a large jar, connected
with the free atmosphere by a tube, so curved as to
prevent the possibility of any dust, or fluid, or solid
matter, from entering into the jar. His object was
to ascertain whether any siliceous earth would be
formed in the process of vegetation; but the oats
grew very feebly, and began to be yellow before
any flowers formed. The entire plants were burnt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
and their ashes compared with those from an equal
number of grains of oat. Less siliceous earth was
given by the plants than by the grains; but their
ashes yielded much more carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>Numerous other authorities might be quoted to the
same effect. Jacquin states that the ashes of Glasswort
(<em>Salsola-Soda</em>) when it grows in inland situations,
afford the vegetable alkali; but when on the
sea-shore, the fossile or mineral alkali. Du Hamel
also found, that plants which usually grow on the sea-shore,
made small progress when planted in soils
containing little common salt. The Sunflower,
when growing on lands not containing nitre, does
not afford that substance; though when watered by
its solution, it yields nitre abundantly. De Saussure
made plants grow in solutions of different salts;
and he ascertained that, in all cases, certain portions
of the salts were absorbed by the plant, and found
unaltered in their organs.</p>

<p>It may be admitted then as established, that the
mineral principles found in plants are derived from
the soils in which they vegetate. This fact becomes
the foundation of the theory respecting the operation
of mineral manure.</p>

<p>Davy observes, that "the only substances which
can with propriety be called fossile manures, and
which are found unmixed with the remains of any
organized beings, are certain alkaline earths, or alkalies,
and their combinations." If he intends to limit
the term to those bodies only which find their way
into the structure of plants, his definition may be
correct; but I am inclined to take a much wider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
view of the subject, and to include all those mineral
substances which promote vegetation by modifying
the texture of the soil:&mdash;but of this hereafter.</p>

<p>Lime, not only from its importance, but from the
controversies which it has occasioned, ranks first in
the list of mineral manures.</p>

<p>That disputes concerning the uses of lime and its
carbonate, should have long existed, and be still continued
amongst a class of persons who, whatever may
be their practical knowledge, are not acquainted
with the composition of the substances about which
they differ, is certainly by no means extraordinary.
Davy, therefore, very properly introduces the subject,
by a description of the nature and qualities
of these bodies, and by marking the distinctions
between quicklime and its carbonate.</p>

<p>The substance commonly known by the name of
<em>Limestone</em> is a compound of lime and carbonic acid,
associated generally with other earthy bodies, the
nature and proportions of which vary in different
species. "When a limestone does not copiously
effervesce in acids, and is sufficiently hard to scratch
glass, it contains siliceous, and probably aluminous
earth. When it is deep brown or red, or strongly
coloured of any of the shades of brown or yellow, it
contains oxide of iron; when it is not sufficiently
hard to scratch glass, but effervesces slowly, and
makes the dilute nitric acid in which it effervesces
milky, it contains magnesia; and when it is black,
and emits a fetid smell if rubbed, it contains coally
or bituminous matter."</p>

<p>As the agricultural value of limestone is materially
modified by the substances with which it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
be associated, their analysis becomes an object of
much importance, and the author has accordingly
proposed a simple method of effecting it.</p>

<p>Before any opinion can be formed of the manner
in which these different ingredients operate, it is
necessary that the action of the pure calcareous element
as a manure should be thoroughly understood.</p>

<p>In its caustic state, whether used in powder, or
dissolved in water, lime is injurious to plants.
Davy informs us that he has, in several instances,
killed grass by watering it with lime water; but in
its combination with carbonic acid, it is an useful
ingredient in soils.</p>

<p>When newly-burnt lime is exposed to the atmosphere,
it soon falls into powder, from uniting with
the moisture of the air; and the same effect is immediately
produced by throwing water upon it,
when it heats violently, and the water disappears:
in this state it is commonly called <em>slacked</em> lime:
chemists have named it the <em>hydrat</em> of lime; and
when this hydrat becomes a carbonate, by long exposure
to the air, its water is in part expelled, and
the carbonic acid takes its place.</p>

<p>Lime, whether freshly burnt, or slacked, acts
powerfully on moist fibrous vegetable matters, and
forms with them a compost, of which a part is
usually soluble in water. By this operation, it renders
inert vegetable matter active; and as charcoal
and oxygen (the elements of carbonic acid) abound
in vegetables, it is itself, at the same time, converted
into a carbonate. But limestone simply powdered,
marls, or chalks, do not thus act on vegetable matter;
and hence the operation of quicklime and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
mild lime depends on principles altogether different.
Quicklime acts on any hard vegetable matter,
so as to render it more readily soluble; the
mild limes, or carbonates, act only by improving the
texture of the soil, or by supplying a due proportion
of calcareous matter: thus almost all soils which do
not effervesce with acids, are improved by mild lime
and sand, more than clays. I apprehend that it is
upon this principle the application of shelly sand
proves beneficial in Cornwall, although I have ascertained
that, on some occasions, its value depends
upon its chemical action upon mineral bodies in
the soil.</p>

<p>Soils abounding in soluble vegetable manures are
injured by quicklime, as it tends to decompose their
soluble matters, or to form with them compounds
less soluble than the pure vegetable substance.
With animal manures, it is equally exceptionable,
unless indeed they be too rich, or it becomes necessary
to prevent noxious effluvia: for since it decomposes
them, it destroys their efficacy, and tends to
render the extractive matter insoluble.</p>

<p>The limestones containing alumina and silex are
less fitted for the purposes of manure than pure
limestones; but the lime formed from them has no
noxious quality. Such stones are less efficacious,
merely because they furnish a smaller quantity of
quicklime. Those, however, that contain magnesia,
if indiscreetly used, may be very detrimental.</p>

<p>It had been long known to farmers in the neighbourhood
of Doncaster, that lime made from a certain
limestone, when applied to the land, often
injured the crops considerably. Mr. Tennant discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
that this limestone contained magnesia;
and on mixing some calcined magnesia with soil,
in which he sowed different seeds, he found that
they either died, or very imperfectly vegetated;
and with great justice and ingenuity, he referred
the bad effects of the peculiar limestone to the
magnesian earth it contained. In prosecuting the
enquiry, Davy however ascertained that there were
cases in which this magnesian lime was used with
good effect,&mdash;in small quantities, for example, on
rich land: and during his chemical consideration of
the question, he was led to the following satisfactory
solution.</p>

<p>"Magnesia has a much weaker attraction for carbonic
acid than lime, and will remain in the state
of caustic or calcined magnesia for many months,
though exposed to the air; and as long as any
caustic lime remains, the magnesia cannot be combined
with carbonic acid, for lime instantly attracts
carbonic acid from magnesia. When therefore a
magnesian limestone is burnt, the magnesia is deprived
of its carbonic acid much sooner than the
lime, and in this state it is a poison to plants. That
more magnesian lime may be used upon rich soils,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
seems to be owing to the circumstance, that the
decomposition of the manure in them supplies carbonic
acid, and thus converts it into a mild carbonate.
Besides being used in the forms of lime
and carbonate of lime, calcareous matter is applied
for the purposes of agriculture in other combinations.
The principal body of this kind is <em>gypsum,</em>
or sulphate of lime; respecting the uses and operation
of which very discordant opinions have been
formed.</p>

<p>Its beneficial operation has been referred to two
causes, viz. to its power of attracting moisture from
the air, or to its assisting the putrefaction of animal
substances; but Davy has shown by experiments
that neither of these theories can be supported by
facts.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary circumstance perhaps connected
with the history of this mineral manure, is
the very opposite opinions which have been formed
respecting its value. In this country, although
there are various testimonies in its favour, it has
never been employed with the signal success which
marked its adoption in America, and which was
so palpable and extraordinary as at once to have
ensured its universal introduction.</p>

<p>I was some years since assured by Mr. Maclure
of Philadelphia, that whenever any doubt or hesitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
betrayed itself with respect to its fertilizing
agency, it was only necessary to sprinkle a small
quantity in a meadow, to satisfy the most sceptical;
and that this was usually done in the form of letters
or characters, which in a short time became so much
more luxuriant than the surrounding grass, as to be
visible at a considerable distance. It is, I understand,
chiefly applied to grass lands as a <em>top-dressing</em>;
and the American farmers<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> explain its operation
upon its solubility in water, and its consequent
absorption by the roots of the grass. Davy, in
examining the ashes of sainfoin, clover, and rye-grass,
which had grown in soils manured by gypsum,
found considerable quantities of that substance;
and he thinks it probable that it was intimately
connected with their woody fibre. He attempts to
explain the reason why the application of gypsum
is not generally efficacious, by supposing that most
of the cultivated soils may already contain it in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
sufficient quantities for the use of the grasses. I
strongly suspect, however, that it will be hereafter
discovered to depend upon the nature of the soil in
its hygrometric relations. From the facts already
recorded, it would appear that it never answers near
the sea, nor in wet lands. In consequence of its
solubility, it is enabled to penetrate and pervade the
whole vegetable structure; and the experiments of
Davy have proved its presence in the ashes of plants
exposed to its operation, and have rendered it probable
that it enters into union with their woody
fibre, by which the density of their textures will be
increased, and consequently the evaporation from
their leaves diminished; I am from such considerations
induced to think that gypsum does not
act by effecting any chemical change in the soil, but
solely by diminishing the plants evaporation. This
idea seems to be borne out by the evidence furnished
by the different circumstances attending the
operation of this manure: we find, for example,
that succulent vegetables, planted on dry soils, are
those which are principally benefited by its application,
and that the various grasses so manured
retain their verdure, even in the dryest season and
on the most arid lands; at the same time, we find
that these crops, especially clover, acquire a proportionate
increase in the density of their fibres,
that is to say, that they become much more rank
and stubborn, and often to such a degree does this
take place, that in America, where its effects are
best understood, sheep not uncommonly refuse to
feed upon them. Upon the same principle we find
that, under circumstances or in situations where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
evaporation of a plant is provided for by a constant
supply of moisture, the effects of gypsum cease to
be apparent.</p>

<p>Davy hints at a process by which gypsum may
be formed in a soil containing sulphate of iron, by
the action of calcareous manure,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and which was
first pointed out by Dr. Pearson. I can confirm
this statement by the results of experiments I formerly
made in Cornwall, where soil containing this
salt of iron had been manured by shelly sand.</p>

<p>In pursuing his enquiry into the efficacy of mineral
manure, Davy proceeds to investigate the
efficacy of the fixed alkalies, and observes that their
general tendency is to give solubility to vegetable
matters, and in this way to render carbonaceous and
other substances capable of being taken up by the
tubes in the radical fibres of plants. The vegetable
alkali has likewise a strong attraction for water, and
even in small quantities may tend to give a due
degree of moisture to the soil, or to other manures.</p>

<p>He considers that pure salt may act, like gypsum,
phosphate of lime, and the alkalies, by entering into
the composition of the plant. Upon the subject of
salt, however, his remarks are very meagre and unsatisfactory:
at the time he composed his lecture,
the subject had not excited that public attention
which the writings of Mr. Parkes, Sir Thomas
Bernard, and others, have since awakened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
Had our philosopher undertaken the agricultural
survey of Cornwall, his lecture on mineral manure
must have been very considerably extended. He
would have learnt that various rocks reduced to
small fragments, are commonly applied as dressing;
he would have explained the cause of the fertility
so generally associated with hornblende rocks;&mdash;he
would have speculated upon the influence of iron
in giving fruitfulness; and above all, he would have
taught the agriculturist the scientific use of calcareous
sand, by pointing out the description of
lands which are most likely to be benefited by its
application.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighth Lecture</span> concludes the subject of
the chemistry of Agriculture, by establishing the
theory of the operation of burning lands. He considers
the process to be useful in rendering the soil
less compact, and less tenacious and retentive of
moisture; and that, when properly applied, it is
capable of converting a matter that was stiff, damp,
and cold, into one powdery, dry, and warm, and
much more proper as a bed for vegetable life. He
states the great objection made by speculative chemists
to paring and burning, to be the unavoidable
destruction of vegetable and animal matter, or the
manure of the soil; but he considers that, in those
cases in which the texture of its earthy ingredients
is permanently improved, there is more than a compensation
for so temporary a disadvantage; and that
in some soils, where there is an excess of inert vegetable
matter, the destruction of it must be beneficial,
and that the carbonaceous matter remaining in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
ashes may be more useful to the crop than the vegetable
fibre from which it was produced.</p>

<p>In this view of the subject it is evident, that all
poor siliceous sands must be injured by the operation;
"and here," says Davy, "practice is found to
accord with theory. Mr. Arthur Young, in his
Essay on Manures, states, 'that he found burning
injure sand;' and the operation is never performed
by good agriculturists upon siliceous sandy soils,
after they have been once brought into cultivation.
An intelligent farmer in Mount's Bay told me, that
he had pared and burned a small field several years
ago, which he had not been able to bring again into
good condition. I examined the spot,&mdash;the grass
was very poor and scanty, and the soil an arid siliceous
sand." <em>Irrigation</em>, or <em>watering land</em>, is a practice,
he observes, which at first view appears the
reverse of torrefaction; and, in general, the operation
of water in nature is to bring earthy substances
into an extreme state of division. But in the artificial
watering of meadows, the beneficial effects
may depend upon many different causes, some chemical,
some mechanical. It may act as a simple
supply of moisture to the roots, or it may carry into
the soil foreign matter, or diffuse that which exists
in it more equally through its substance.</p>

<p>He concludes with some valuable scientific observations
upon the process of <em>fallowing</em>, by which he
attempts to correct the prejudices which have existed
with regard to its benefits. He points out, on
the other hand, the great advantages of the convertible
system of husbandry, by which the whole of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
the manure is employed; and those parts of it which
are not fitted for one crop, remain as nourishment
for another. These views he illustrates by a reference
to the course of crops adopted by Mr. Coke,
in which "the turnip is the first in the order of
succession; and this crop is manured with recent
dung, which immediately affords sufficient soluble
matter for its nourishment; and the heat produced
in fermentation assists the germination of the seed
and the growth of the plant. After turnips, barley
with grass seeds is sown; and the land having been
little exhausted by the turnip crop, affords the soluble
parts of the decomposing manure to the grain.
The grasses, rye-grass, and clover remain, which
derive a small part only of their organized matter
from the soil, and probably consume the gypsum in
the manure which would be useless to other crops;
these plants likewise, by their large system of leaves,
absorb a considerable quantity of nourishment from
the atmosphere; and when ploughed in at the end of
two years, the decay of their roots and leaves affords
manure for the wheat crop; and at this period of
the course, the woody fibre of the farm-yard manure,
which contains the phosphate of lime and the
other difficultly soluble parts, is broken down; and
as soon as the most exhausting crop is taken, recent
manure is again supplied."</p>

<p>At the end of his system is added an Appendix,
containing "An Account of the results of Experiments
on the produce and nutritive qualities of the
Grasses and other plants used as the food of animals;
instituted by John Duke of Bedford." But as these
experiments do not admit either of abridgement or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
analysis, the reader must refer to the original source
for information.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this long, and, I fear, somewhat
tedious review, with the animated appeal so earnestly
addressed by the illustrious author to the philosophical
readers of his work.</p>

<p>"I trust that the enquiry will be pursued by
others; and that in proportion as chemical philosophy
advances towards perfection, it will afford new
aids to agriculture: there are sufficient motives connected
both with pleasure and profit, to encourage
ingenious men to pursue this new path of investigation.
Science cannot long be despised by any persons
as the mere speculation of theorists, but must
soon be considered by all ranks of men in its true
point of view, as the refinement of common sense
guided by experience, gradually substituting sound
and rational principles for vague popular prejudices.</p>

<p>"The soil offers inexhaustible resources, which,
when properly appreciated and employed, must increase
our wealth, our population, and our physical
strength.</p>

<p>"We possess advantages in the use of machinery,
and the division of labour, belonging to no other
nation. And the same energy of character, the
same extent of resources, which have always distinguished
the people of the British Islands, and made
them excel in arms, commerce, letters, and philosophy,
apply with the happiest effects to the improvement
of the cultivation of the earth. Nothing is
impossible to labour, aided by ingenuity. The true
objects of the agriculturist are likewise those of the
patriot. Men value most what they have gained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
with effort; a just confidence in their own powers
results from success; they love their country better,
because they have seen it improved by their own
talents and industry; and they identify with their
interests the existence of those institutions which
have afforded them security, independence, and the
multiplied enjoyments of civilized life."</p>

and in the next, to the introduction of composition for
the enrichment of picture-frames and other objects of ornament.

Scheele; for on one occasion, as the latter was employed in making

some fulminating powder into the mixture; the consequence was
a violent explosion; the whole family was thrown into confusion,

appears to have justly appreciated the influence of circumstances
upon the destinies of great men. In speaking of Buonaparte
at the Military College of Brienne, he says, "If the monks,
to whom the superintendence of the establishment was confided,
had engaged more able mathematical professors, or if we had had
any excitement to the study of Chemistry, or Natural Philosophy,
I am convinced that Buonaparte would have pursued those sciences
with all the genius and spirit of investigation, which he displayed
in a career more brilliant, it is true, but far less useful to mankind."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> Bergman, Professor of Upsal, was informed of a young man
who resided in the house of an apothecary, and who was reproached
for neglecting the duties of his profession, while he devoted the
whole of his time to Chemistry. Bergman's curiosity was excited;
he paid him a visit, and was astonished at the knowledge he displayed,
and at the profound researches in which he was engaged,
notwithstanding the poverty under which he laboured, and the
restraint under which his situation placed him. He encouraged
his ardour, and made him his friend. This young man was the
celebrated <em>Scheele</em>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> No man ever entered upon an undertaking with less apparent
means of success, than did Priestley upon that of Chemistry. He
neither possessed apparatus, nor the money to procure it. These
circumstances, which at first sight seem so adverse, were in reality
those which contributed to his ultimate success. The branch of
Chemistry he selected was new; an apparatus had to be invented
before any important step could be taken; and as simplicity is
essential in every research, he was likely to contrive the best whose
circumstances obliged him to attend to economy.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> Plutarch, in expressing the opinion of Asclepiades upon this
subject, represents him as saying, that the external air, <em>by its
weight</em>, opened its way with force into the breast. Seneca also
was acquainted with the weight and elastic force of the air; for
he describes the constant effort by which it expands itself when it
is compressed, and affirms that it has the property of condensing
itself, and of forcing its way through all obstacles that oppose
its passage.&mdash;Quæst. Nat. lib. v. c. v. and vi.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> Brugnatelli considered that oxygen, in certain cases of combination,
entered into union with different bodies, without parting with its <em>caloric</em>;
and in that state he gave it the name of <span class="smcap">Therm-oxygen</span>;
so that Davy had a precedent for his nomenclatural
innovation.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> Breath and life are synonymous. In the Greek, the most

breath and life, is evident.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> The only pun Davy is said to have ever made was upon the
occasion of Mr. Sadler being appointed by Dr. Beddoes as his
successor. "I cannot imagine," said he, "why he has engaged
<em>Sadler</em>, unless it is that he may be well <em>bridled</em>."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> The following is the account given in his Essay. "When
sulphuric acid was poured into a solution of this salt in water, a
beautiful and unexpected phenomenon took place. The room was
accidentally darkened at the moment this experiment was made, so
that we were enabled to perceive a vivid luminous appearance.
This experiment, independent of its beauty, is extremely pleasing
as affording an instance of true combustion, that is, the production
of Light and Heat by the mixture of two incombustible bodies."
It may be presumed, that this phenomenon arose from the developement
and decomposition of a portion of Euchlorine, a compound
which he subsequently discovered in 1811. In the year
1813, Chevreul announced, as a new discovery, that if strontian be
heated in contact with muriatic acid gas, the gas is absorbed, and
the earthy salt becomes red hot.&mdash;<cite>See Annals of Philosophy</cite>, vol. ii.

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> With respect to the metaphysical speculation contained in
this paragraph of his letter, had he not written it in haste, we
might presume he would have given a more exact expression to his
ideas. By the misapplied term "<em>Feeling of Procrastination</em>," he
doubtless meant to describe that aversion to labour which becomes
habit by indulgence, and the perception of which, so far from increasing
in vividness, actually languishes to obtuseness. To borrow
an expression from Dr. Johnson, Davy, in his metaphysical
speculations, not unfrequently trod upon the brink of meaning,
where light and darkness begin to mingle.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> Davy here alludes to the fact of magnesian earth being prejudicial

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> It would thus appear that carbonic acid, in its most concentrated
form, may kill by exciting a spasmodic action, in which the
epiglottis is closed, and the entrance of air into the lungs altogether
prevented. In a diluted form, it may destroy by its specific
influence upon the blood, which would seem to be of a highly
sedative character. Death produced by such an agent is probably
attended with little or no suffering. The younger Berthollet destroyed
his life by inclosing himself in an atmosphere of this description;
and on commencing his fatal experiment, he registered
all the successive feelings he experienced, which were such as
would have been occasioned by a narcotic:&mdash;a pause, and then
an almost illegible word occurred: it is presumed that the pen
dropped from his hand,&mdash;and he was no more.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_32" id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">[32]</a> On conversing with Mr. Gilbert on the above passage, I
understand that it is an allusion to his opinion, that the discovery
of Galvanic power would ultimately lead to a knowledge of the
nature of light and heat.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_33" id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> Mr. Gilbert no sooner discovered the tendency of Davy's
opinions respecting the immateriality of Caloric, than he urged
him to communicate them to Count Rumford, but he considered
himself pledged to Dr. Beddoes, and his Essays were accordingly
printed in the West Country Contributions. Count Rumford, it
may be observed, maintained that Caloric, like <em>Phlogiston</em>, was
merely a creature of the chemist's imagination, and had no real
existence. He considered heat as nothing more than the motions
of the constituent particles of bodies amongst themselves,&mdash;an
hypothesis which has no claims to novelty, being perhaps one of
the most ancient on record.&mdash;See his paper on Heat, <cite>Phil. Trans.</cite>
for 1804.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_34" id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> Amongst other celebrated chemists who had become acquainted
with Davy at Bristol, and subsequently spoken of his
extraordinary genius, was Dr. Hope. He informs me that Count
Rumford had applied to him to find some chemist who would undertake
the office of lecturer at the Institution; but that he failed in
discovering such a person as he could, with propriety, introduce;
some time afterwards, however, he became acquainted with
Davy, and having soon perceived his talents, recommended him
without any hesitation to the patronage of the Count. This circumstance,
combined with several others, no doubt might have
had its influence in deciding the fate of Davy.</p>

our institutions, while science unfortunately finds so few disciples
and patrons in the ranks of aristocracy, that every new society is
viewed with jealousy and party spirit. Johnson says, in his Life of

<p><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">[43]</a> The masterly manner in which he combated the successive
arguments of Berthollet upon this question is admirable. In the
first place, he attacked the theory upon general principles, and
then exposed the fallacy of the several experiments adduced in its
support. "Were the proposition correct, that <em>in all cases of decomposition
in which two bodies act upon a third, that third is divided between
them in proportion to their relative affinities, and their quantities
of matter</em>, it is quite evident that there could be scarcely any definite
proportions: a salt crystallizing in a strong alkaline solution
would be strongly alkaline; in a weak one, less alkaline; and in
an acid solution it would be acid." With regard to glasses and
alloys, adduced by M. Berthollet as compounds of indefinite proportions,
Davy answers&mdash;"It is not easy to prove, in such cases,
that the elements are chemically combined, for the points of fusion
of alkali, glass, and certain metallic oxides, are so near to
each other, that transparent mixtures of them may be formed."
The experiment upon which M. Berthollet laid great stress, viz.
that a large quantity of potash will separate a small quantity of
sulphuric acid from sulphate of baryta, Davy invalidates in a most
complete manner. He says&mdash;"This experiment was made in contact
with the atmosphere, in which carbonic acid is always present;
and carbonate of potash and sulphate of baryta mutually decompose
each other."</p>

is given of the Holkham Sheep-shearing for 1803, and in
the list of the company is the name of "Mr. Professor Davy."&mdash;At
the meeting of 1808, he was also present, and is mentioned as
the great chemist, whose discoveries will immortalize his name.
Mr. Coke, in the course of his speech after dinner, alluding to the
question of long and short dung, said, "It is the opinion of a
friend of mine, who sits near me, Professor Davy, and upon whose
judgment, on account of his extensive chemical as well as other
scientific knowledge, I place the highest reliance, that the manure
carried immediately on the field, without being disturbed, will have
a greater effect in exciting rapid vegetation, and in encouraging the
growth of the turnip plant, than when applied in the ordinary manner;
for, under such circumstances, it will not only be more moist and
alkaline, but it will be protected from a loss of substance, amounting
very nearly to one-third of its original bulk." Davy afterwards, in
company with the Duke of Bedford, Lord William Russell, Lord
Thanet, Sir Joseph Banks, and other agriculturists, inspected
several farms.&mdash;In 1812, his health was drunk at the Woburn
Sheep-shearing by the Duke of Bedford; and in the following
festival it was proposed by Lord Hardwicke.</p>

<p>In the print of the "Woburn Sheep-shearing," published by
Garrard, in 1811, No. 75 represents Davy; he is standing, in a

Joseph Banks, Sir John Sinclair, and Mr. Arthur Young.</p>

part of a letter from Dr. Ash, in which it is said that, "if two
finely polished plates of homogeneous zinc be moistened and laid
together, little effect follows; but if zinc and silver be tried in the
same way, the whole surface of the silver will be covered with oxidated
zinc. Lead and quicksilver act as powerfully upon each
other, and so do iron and copper. M. Humboldt says, that, in
repeating this experiment, he saw air bubbles ascend, which he
supposes to have been hydrogen gas from the decomposition of
water.</p>

these Memoirs, in connexion with most important discoveries, it
may be interesting to the reader to learn something of its foundation
and design. I have therefore collected the necessary information
from the Minutes of the Royal Society. Mr. Baker is well
known in the history of Science, as an accurate observer with the
microscope, and as the author of several works on the subject. By
his will, dated July 1763, he bequeathed the sum of one hundred
pounds, the interest of which he directed "to be applied for an
Oration or Discourse, to be read or spoken yearly by some one of
the Fellows of the Royal Society, on such parts of Natural History,
or Experimental Philosophy, at such time, and in such manner, as
the President and Council of the said Society shall please to order
and appoint; on condition, nevertheless, that if any one year shall
pass after the payment of the said hundred pounds, without such
oration or discourse having been read or spoken at some Meeting
of the said Royal Society, the said hundred pounds shall then become
forfeited, and shall be repaid by the said Society to his
executors," &amp;c. Baker died in November 1774, and in the following
year a Fellow was nominated to read the lecture. It is a
whimsical circumstance, that the first lecturer should have been
<span class="smcap">Peter Woulfe</span>, the last of the alchemists. The names of the
successive lecturers were as follow:&mdash;Dr. Ingenhouz, Mr. Cavallo,
Mr. Vince, Dr. Wollaston, Dr. Young, Sir H. Davy, Mr. Brande,
Captain Kater, Captain Edward Sabine, and Mr. Herschel.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_60" id="Footnote_60" href="#FNanchor_60" class="label">[60]</a> M. Bonijol of Geneva has lately succeeded in effecting the decomposition
of <em>Potash</em> and the <em>Chloride of Silver</em> by ordinary electricity.
His process consists in placing these substances in a very
narrow glass tube, and in then passing a series of electric sparks
from the ordinary machine through them. The electricity was
conducted into the tube by means of two metallic wires fixed into
the ends. When a quick succession of electric sparks had taken
place for about five or ten minutes, the tube containing chloride
of silver was found to contain reduced silver; and when potash
had been submitted to the electric current, then the Potassium was
seen to take fire as it was produced. The same philosopher has
likewise contrived to decompose water by atmospheric electricity.
The electricity, in this case, is collected from the atmosphere by
means of a very fine point fixed at the extremity of an insulated
rod; the latter is connected with the apparatus, in which the water
is to be decomposed, by a metallic wire, of which the diameter does
not exceed 1-50th of an inch. In this way the decomposition of
the water proceeds in a continuous and rapid manner, although the
atmospheric electricity be not strong. Stormy weather, it is said,
is quite sufficient for the purpose.&mdash;<cite>Bib. Univers.</cite> 1830, p. 213. and

<p><a name="Footnote_65" id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">[65]</a> Reflecting upon this and similar facts, it has occurred to me
that Voltaic electricity might be applied for removing the blue colour

I hope to be able very shortly to submit this theory to the test.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_66" id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="label">[66]</a> During the contentions of the Neptunists and Plutonists, alluded
to in a former part of this work, specimens were produced
exhibiting the intermixture of mineral bodies, which was completely
hostile to all theory. These anomalies now receive a plausible explanation
from the agencies of Voltaic electricity.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_68" id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="label">[68]</a> Dr. Priestley augured much from the talents of Davy. After
the publication of his first paper on Galvanism, he wrote to him
from America, and expressed the pleasure he felt on finding his
favourite subject in such able hands. Priestley died in 1804, and
therefore did not witness Davy's success.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_69" id="Footnote_69" href="#FNanchor_69" class="label">[69]</a> A most remarkable illustration of this fact occurs in the history
of Locke, who certainly came as near to an important discovery
as any philosopher who ever caught a glimpse of a truth
without seizing it; but his statement did not, in any degree, hasten
the developement of that new branch of science which was reserved
for the genius of Dr. Black to investigate, and who a century later,
by the discovery of fixed air, changed the whole face of Chemistry.
The passage to which I allude is extracted from the Life by Lord
King, and is so curious, that I shall give it a place in this note.
"M. Toinard produced a large bottle of Muscat: it was clear when
he set it on the table; but when he had drawn out the stopper, a
multitude of little bubbles arose, and swelled the wine above the
mouth of the bottle. It comes from this, that the air, which was
included and disseminated in the liquor, had liberty to expand
itself, and so to become visible, and, being much lighter than the
liquor, to mount with great quickness.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quere</i>, Whether this be
air new generated, or whether the springy particles of air in the
fruit, out of which these fermenting liquors are drawn, have, by the
artifice of Nature, been pressed close together, and there by other
particles fastened and held so; and whether fermentation does not
loose these bands, and give them liberty to expand themselves
again? Take a bottle of fermenting liquor, and tie a bladder on
the mouth.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quere</i>, How much new air will it produce; and
whether this has the quality of common air?"</p>

<p>Another instance equally illustrative of the manner in which
important truths will sometimes elude notice, even after Science
has approached so near as to touch them, is presented in the
history of the Barometer. Toricelli, the pupil of Galileo, while
reflecting upon the phenomenon which had so greatly perplexed
his master, viz. that water could not be raised above thirty-two
feet in the body of a pump, rightly conjectured that the water,
under such circumstances, was not <em>drawn</em>, but <em>pushed up</em> into the
barrel, and that it could only be so pushed up by the force of the
atmosphere. It then occurred to him, that if mercury were used
instead of water, being heavier, it would not be pushed up so high
by the weight of the air. So, taking a glass tube of about three
feet in height, made air-tight at one end, he first filled it completely
with quicksilver, and then closing it with his finger, reversed
it in a basin containing that metal; when he had the gratification
of seeing the liquid in the tube descend, as he had
anticipated. Here then was the discovery of the <span class="smcap">Barometer</span>;
but it was reserved for another to find out that such an instrument
had been actually invented. Pascal first made the remark, that
the inference of Toricelli, if true, might be confirmed by carrying
the mercurial tube to a considerable elevation; when the atmospheric
column being diminished, that of the mercury, which was
supposed to be its balance, ought likewise to be shortened in a
corresponding proportion. It followed then, that a measure of the
weight of the atmosphere, in all circumstances, had been obtained,
and consequently that of the height of any place to which the
instrument could be carried. In this manner was a discovery
completed, which had for ages escaped the greatest philosophers
who had made the nearest approaches to its developement.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_71" id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">[71]</a> The propriety, and even the necessity, of such a compact become
daily more apparent, as our knowledge of bodies extends. If
we were to degrade a substance from its class, in consequence of
the absence of some one quality which enters into its more perfect
examples, we should soon find ourselves involved in paradoxes.&mdash;What
idea, for instance, could we form of an acid?&mdash;Its sourness?&mdash;Prussic
Acid&mdash;Arsenious Acid, are not sour.&mdash;Its tendency to
combine with an alkaline or earthy base?&mdash;If so, sugar is an acid,
for it combines with lime. I remember a chemist having been exposed
to much ridicule from speaking of a <em>sweet</em> acid&mdash;Why not?</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_72" id="Footnote_72" href="#FNanchor_72" class="label">[72]</a> In the language of Darwin, we should say, that the simple
ideas of weight and lustre, which form the complex idea of a metal,
have become so indissoluble, that they can no longer be separated
by volition. The principle admits of many familiar illustrations,
and is the source of numerous fallacies. When any one voluntarily
recollects a Gothic window, which he had seen some time
before, the whole front of the Cathedral occurs to him at the same
time: in like manner, the taste of a pine-apple, though we eat it
blindfold, recalls the colour and shape of it. Coleridge has made
a good remark upon this subject. He says, "It is a great law of
the imagination, that a likeness in part tends to become a likeness
of the whole." It is thus that we trace images in the fire,
castles in the clouds, and spectres in the gloom of twilight.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_73" id="Footnote_73" href="#FNanchor_73" class="label">[73]</a> If we are disposed to enter into a more critical examination of
the subject, we shall find that, although the above is a general
expression of the change produced, there are subordinate actions
of a more complicated nature: the metal, in the first place, decomposes
a portion of the water, in order to combine with its oxygen,
and form potash, which in its turn has a powerful affinity for water;
the heat arising from two causes, decomposition and combination,
is sufficiently intense to produce the inflammation. Water is a bad
conductor of heat; the globule swims exposed to air; a part of
which is dissolved by the heated nascent hydrogen; and this gas,
being capable of spontaneous inflammation, explodes and communicates
the effect of combustion to any of the bases that may be
yet uncombined. The manner in which the potassium runs along
the surface of water may be compared to a drop of water on red-hot
iron; in the one case the hot potassium, in the other the cold
water, is enveloped in an atmosphere of steam.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_74" id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">[74]</a> In his Bakerian Lecture of 1810, he informs us that he obtains
Sodium by heating common salt, which has been previously ignited,
with Potassium&mdash;an immediate decomposition takes place, and
two parts of Potassium produce rather more than one of Sodium.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_75" id="Footnote_75" href="#FNanchor_75" class="label">[75]</a> Many years afterwards, when Davy was travelling on the
Continent, a distinguished person about a foreign court, enquired
who and what he was; never having heard of his scientific fame.
Upon being told that his discoveries had revolutionized Chemistry,
the courtier promptly replied&mdash;"I hate all revolutionists&mdash;his presence
will not be acceptable here."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_77" id="Footnote_77" href="#FNanchor_77" class="label">[77]</a> He alludes to a Paper, entitled "On the Quantity of Carbon
in Carbonic Acid, and on the Nature of the Diamond; by William
Allen, Esq. F.R.S. and William Hasledine Pepys, Esq." Communicated
by Humphry Davy, Sec. R.S. M.R.I.A. Read June 16,

<p><a name="Footnote_78" id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="label">[78]</a> He here alludes to a train of research, which will be considered
hereafter.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_79" id="Footnote_79" href="#FNanchor_79" class="label">[79]</a> This observation relates to the magnificent battery constructed
by Mr. Children, of which he presented an account to the Royal
Society, in a Paper read in November 1808, entitled, "An Account
of some Experiments, performed with a view to ascertain the most
advantageous Method of constructing a Voltaic Apparatus, for
the purpose of Chemical Research. By John George Children,
Esq. F.R.S." The great battery described in this Paper consisted
of twenty pairs of plates, each plate being four feet high by two
feet wide: the sum of all the surfaces was ninety-two thousand
one hundred and sixty square inches, and the quantity of liquid
necessary for charging it, one hundred and twenty gallons. At
the same time he constructed another battery, which consisted of
two hundred pairs of plates, each being only two inches square.
In the one case, then, he commanded extent of surface, in the
other, extent of number; and by a series of comparative experiments,
he fully established the theory of Davy (page <a href="#Page_246">246</a>), that the
<em>intensity</em> of Electricity increases with the <em>number</em>, and the <em>quantity</em>
with the <em>surface</em>.</p>

together any combustible body, as gum, flour, sugar, charcoal, &amp;c.
and alum, and then, after roasting the mixture till it was reduced
to a dry powder, exposing it in a matrass to a red heat. In this
process, the theory of which was first explained by Davy, the
potash of the alum is converted into potassium, which, by its
absorption of oxygen from the atmosphere, generates heat, and
sets fire to the charcoal contained in the powder.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_84" id="Footnote_84" href="#FNanchor_84" class="label">[84]</a> The late interesting experiments of Mr. Daniell "on the
action of Mercury on different Metals," which have been recently
published in the first number of a new series of the Journal of the
Royal Institution, appear to throw much light upon this subject.
By agitating a few grains of spongy platinum with mercury in
water acidified with acetic acid, he obtained an amalgam of the
consistence of soft butter, which retained its consistence for many
weeks, and greatly resembled that formed by the electrization of
mercury in contact with ammonia. When the amalgam was laid
upon filtering paper, the moisture was gradually absorbed and
evaporated, and the mercury returned to a fluid state. By a more
refined experiment, Mr. Daniell ascertained that the process was
accompanied by the evolution of hydrogen gas; whence he very
fairly concludes, that, when minutely divided, platinum is agitated
with mercury, and moisture is present, an electrical action takes
place, which, when heightened by the addition of a diluted acid, or
the solution of a neutral salt, is sufficiently energetic to decompose
water and evolve hydrogen: the oxygen at the same time combines
with the mercury, and a solution is effected by the acetic acid,
which its unassisted affinity could not have produced. "It also
appears," continues Mr. Daniell, "that this electrical action
communicates an adhesive attraction to the particles of the metal, by
which the particles of liquid and aëriform bodies are entangled
and retained, a kind of <em>frothy</em> compound formed, and the fluidity
of the mercury destroyed. The appearance of this amalgam is so
very like that of the ammoniacal compound formed by exposing a
solution of ammonia in contact with mercury to the influence of
the Voltaic pile, or when an amalgam of potassium and mercury is
placed upon moistened muriate of ammonia, that it is impossible
not to be struck with the resemblance. Mr. Daniell is therefore
inclined to believe that the production of the latter may be explained
upon the same principles as that of the former. When the
effect is produced by the direct application of the electrical current,
by means of the battery, it ceases the moment the connexion
between the poles is broken; and when brought about by the
agency of the amalgam of potassium, the electrical action is doubtless
excited by the contact of the two dissimilar metals, and the
frothy compound lasts no longer than the existence of the potassium
in the metallic state; whereas in the action between mercury
and finely divided platinum, the permanence of the metals produces
a much more lasting effect, and the soft amalgam may therefore
be preserved for a greater length of time.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_85" id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85" class="label">[85]</a> "On the Electro-chemical Decomposition of the Vegeto-Alkaline
Salts." In this communication, the Professor gives an account
of some experiments of his own, with a view to ascertain
whether the vegetable alkalies, if electrised in contact with mercury,
would impart any principle to the latter metal. In experiments
with morphia and cinchonia, in which the mercury in
contact with the vegetable base was rendered negative, not the
least change in the fluidity of the metal could be perceived.
When, however, a similar experiment was made with quina, the
metal became filmy, and acquired even a tendency to a butyraceous
appearance, but the phenomenon was found to depend upon
the presence of a minute portion of lime.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_86" id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="label">[86]</a> The difficulty of seizing upon elementary forms, as well as
the infinity of combinations of which they are susceptible, are
supposed by Mr. Sankey to be allegorized in the fable of Proteus,
&#928;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#962;, being derived from &#960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#963;&#962;, signifying the first element.
It is not a little singular that Mr. Leslie, to whom such a speculation
was wholly unknown, should have recognised in the same
fable a picture of the cautious but intrepid advances of the skilful
experimenter: he tries to press Nature into a corner,&mdash;he endeavours
to separate the different principles of action,&mdash;he seeks to
concentrate the predominant agent, and labours to exclude as
much as possible every disturbing influence. Notwithstanding the
confidence with which modern philosophers have claimed the discovery,
the experimental mode of investigation was undoubtedly
known and pursued by the ancients, who appear, observes Mr.
Leslie, to have concealed their notions respecting it under the veil
of allegory. <em>Proteus</em> signified the mutable and changing forms of
material objects; and the inquisitive philosopher was counselled by
the Poets to watch their slippery demon, when slumbering on the
shore to bind him, and to compel the reluctant captive to reveal
his secrets.&mdash;<cite>Elements of Natural Philosophy.</cite></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_87" id="Footnote_87" href="#FNanchor_87" class="label">[87]</a> Berthollet first applied oxymuriatic acid for the purpose of
bleaching, in France; from whence Mr. Watt introduced it into
England.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_88" id="Footnote_88" href="#FNanchor_88" class="label">[88]</a> Dr. Thomson has more recently explained the operation, by
supposing that water is decomposed, and that its hydrogen goes to
the chlorine, and its oxygen to the water, forming with the latter
a deutoxide of hydrogen, or the oxygenated water of Thénard,
which he considers as the true bleaching principle.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_89" id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89" class="label">[89]</a> Experience has not confirmed the value of this suggestion.
Davy imagined that the vegetable fibre was injured by the saline
residuum; and having found that muriate of magnesia was less
corrosive than muriate of lime, he was led to propose the substitute
above stated. The fact, however, is, that the fibre is injured by
the chlorine; and as this body has only a slight affinity for magnesia,
it too quickly abandons it; and consequently the oxymuriate
of lime is still preferred.</p>

by the <em>condensation</em> of oxygen, or chlorine: but in this
instance, a violent explosion with heat and light is produced by
their separation, and <em>expansion</em>; a perfectly novel circumstance
in chemical philosophy.</p>

could never have been adopted with propriety. It is in direct defiance
of the Linnæan precept, that a specific name must not be
united to the generic as a termination; besides which, such terms
could never have been preserved in translations into other languages.</p>

a constant supply of fresh air, the circulation of which was promoted

<p><a name="Footnote_107" id="Footnote_107" href="#FNanchor_107" class="label">[107]</a> The history of his native county would have furnished him
with a parallel instance of the intelligence and design which
Nature displays in connecting the wants and necessities of the different
parts of creation, with the power and means of supplying
them. In a primitive country like Cornwall, the siliceous soil necessarily
requires much moisture, and we may perceive that the
cause which occasions, at the same time supplies this want; for
the rocks elevated above the surface, solicit a tribute from every
passing cloud; while in alluvial and flat districts, where the soil is
rich, deep, and retentive of moisture, the clouds float undisturbed
over the plains, and the country frequently enjoys that uninterrupted
series of dry weather which is so necessary to its fertility.
Linnæus observes, that the plants which chiefly grow upon the
summit of mountains, are rarely found in any other situation,
except in marshes, because the clouds arrested in their progress by
such elevations, keep the air in a state of perpetual moisture.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_111" id="Footnote_111" href="#FNanchor_111" class="label">[111]</a> These facts have been confirmed by agriculturists, who could
not possibly have had any favourite theory to support. Dr. Fenwick
tells us, (Essays on Calcareous Manures, p. 11. 1798,) that
in the county of Durham, the farmers always distinguish between
<em>hot</em> and <em>mild</em> limes. They never apply the former to exhausted
lands, or to any soil that has been long under a course of tillage,
unless it be very deep and rich. In peaty soils, and in new, sour,
and wild lands, the <em>hot</em> limes, on the contrary, are preferred to the
<em>mild</em> ones. Dr. Fenwick made some experiments to ascertain the
cause of the differences between these varieties of lime; and
though he failed to discover that by analysis which Mr. Tennant
subsequently ascertained, he nevertheless arrived at a just conclusion
by simple observation; and was led to believe, that "what
farmers term <em>hot</em> limes, are such as re-absorb their fixed air more
slowly, and therefore continue longer to exert the peculiar action
of quicklime."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_112" id="Footnote_112" href="#FNanchor_112" class="label">[112]</a> When this substance was first introduced into America, which
is nearly forty years since, it was imported from the quarries of
Montmartre, and in such request was it, that a bushel of wheat
was usually given for the same measure of gypsum: it is now, I
believe, obtained from Nova Scotia; I have not heard that it has
been found within the States. It may perhaps serve to convey
some idea of the extent to which it has been applied, when I state,
that Mr. Maclure assured me that not less than three hundred
vessels are constantly employed in the traffic, and that in Philadelphia
twenty merchants, at least, are engaged in supplying the
demand for it. Its efficacy appears to be considerably increased
by applying it in a minute state of division; and a want of attention
to this circumstance may possibly have been one of the causes
which have rendered its advantages less conspicuous in England.
In America, three or four hundred mills, of a peculiar construction,
have been erected in different parts for the purpose of grinding it.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_113" id="Footnote_113" href="#FNanchor_113" class="label">[113]</a> Gypsum is readily produced by the admixture of decomposing
pyrites and calcareous matter: in proof of which the Mineralogist
can produce specimens of oyster shells studded with crystals of
selenite from Shotover; and alum from the <em>aluminous shale</em> at the
Hurlet Mine near Glasgow.</p>
